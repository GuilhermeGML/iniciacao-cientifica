"KernelDeimos","CONTRIBUTOR","The addition to `package.json` and missing imports for `APIError` references look good to me. Would you be willing to move these to a separate PR?

The changes for asset loading break deployment with the bundled version of gui (something we haven't documented yet, but we use it to deploy to puter.com as well), so this needs further evaluation and changes.

Do you still see 404 messages in the console on the latest commit? This is something I'm not able to produce, so my understanding was that #208 was fixed by my recent changes.","2024-04-02T18:49:37Z",false,"COMMENTED"
