"randall77","CONTRIBUTOR","This looks like a bug to me. I think line 1278 should be using r instead of p.Reg.
Not sure though, this exact pattern is not used anywhere else.
Needs a mips expert.

"randall77","CONTRIBUTOR","This function is guaranteed to not return an error.
The previous call to regexp.MatchString didn't fail, so this one can't.
(Errors only depend on the first argument.)

Probably the right fix is to do:
  match, _ = regexp.MatchString(want, got.e)
to indicate we know the error can't happen.
