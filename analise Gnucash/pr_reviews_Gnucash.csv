"gjanssens","MEMBER","Looks good to me.

The use of boost::process::environment is a nice touch. Would it make sense to replace our use of getenv with calls to boost::process::environment as well for consistency ? One way to do that could be to make new_env a member variable of GncFQQuoteSource and populate it at construction time already. That would eliminate the need to store the two api keys themselves as member variables.","2024-09-20T07:46:43Z",false,"COMMENTED"
"jralls","MEMBER","I don't think the chart is particularly useful, there are better ways to get stock price charts. It's anyway misnamed, it's a plain line chart, not a scatterplot. That's a good thing, a price scatterplot wouldn't be very useful either. 

I'm all for getting rid of the different intervals, they don't even change the displayed data, just the numbers along the X axis, and those numbers are themselves pretty useless.
However using the dates of the prices to set the vertical lines makes for a strange-looking plot and it's going to get congested for plots with either a long period or showing frequent quotes. I think it would be better to break the period up into some consistent number of intervals and put date labels on each interval.","2024-09-23T19:20:51Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"jralls","MEMBER","Please use the bug summary for the commit summary; with a two-parter you can append ""part1"" and ""part2"" or similar if you like, but put the explanation of what the commit fixes in the body of the commit message. If you don't think that the bug's summary line is good you can edit it and then use that for your commit summary.

It appears to me that the first commit enables sorting by name, date, and status. If that's correct please say so in the commit message.

The second commit saves the SLR sort order in preferences so that it would apply to all books. Shouldn't it be saved in the metadata file so that it will be per-book?

"jralls","MEMBER","This change doesn't add an option to the dialog, it just totals up the splits in the account's sub accounts if the register is opened with the sub accounts. That's fine, it's intuitively the right thing to do. Please change the commit message to say so.

The check's amount when printing a Find-results dialog in the presence of sub accounts is a bit random, you might take a look at that.

A companion PR to gnucash-docs to update the manual section 6.15 would be nice.","2023-11-06T21:58:59Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"jralls","MEMBER","That's a lot of work, thanks for making the effort. We're trying to reduce our dependencies on GLib, particularly in C++ code, so I'd prefer not to use G_BEGIN/END_DECLS macros. One alternative would be to recreate them with GNC_BEGIN/END_DECLS, but that would require having a common header that gets included everywhere and we don't have one of those and it seems silly to introduce one just for a single macro pair. The other alternative is to replace the macros with their expansion, i.e. `G_BEGIN_DECLS` with `#ifdef __cplusplus…`. Please do the latter.","2023-01-23T17:21:23Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","@Bob-IT It looks like my review will be iterative. My first scan was high level. This time I was triggered by how you changed the handling of ui elements in the plugins. I don't think that's really optimal at this point and that prompted me to grok how all of this works together a bit more.

One thing that still eludes me in general is this: we have a gnc-main-window and several plugin pages that add menu items. How does the code know where to insert the menu items from these plugin pages ? Do you know ?

I would assume the same logic should be applicable for the menu items inserted by aqbanking and ofx.","2022-10-16T18:23:12Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"jralls","MEMBER","Nearly all of the comments apply throughout, not just at the locus of the comment.
Beyond the comments, you need to rethink this. 

Mixing the usages of C structs and C++ classes makes for a hard to read and hard to reason about design. C++ classes should each [do a single job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) and should present a functional interface that performs the job, not be a bundle of variables. When you want a bundle of variables use a struct *with no functions*.

Model, View, and Controller are categories for classes; they should be single classes only in the simplest designs. For example instead of a single StockAssistantView class you might have a class for each page in the assistant and each page class might have its own controller; see the next item.

Note that in the original [MVC design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) the view was the display driver and the controller was the keyboard driver. Modern GUI frameworks like Gtk handle both ends of that, so a more useful way to think of the separation in GnuCash terms is that the View is what Gtk does, the Model is what's in the Engine, and the Controller is whatever (ideally minimal) code is needed in between. This is sometimes called [Model-View-Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–adapter). In practice with Gtk the View classes would contain the Gtk-dependent code and provide an abstracted interface through which the controller could get and set widget values and register signal handlers. The model lives lilbgnucash, and the controller uses the libgnucash API to manipulate data in response to the inputs or to retrieve data to display in the view.

Keep in mind that Gtk itself has its own class hierarchy and memory management system. You want only the thinnest possible C++ wrapper or none at all. Note that a GObject* is already a reference-counted shared pointer. C++ std::shared_ptr and std::unique_ptr require destructor parameters to work correctly with them.

Combining declarations and function implementations the way you have is incredibly hard to read. It's suitable only for simple classes with a few short member functions where short means no more than 3 lines and a few means no more than 5.

Huge classes with more than a dozen or so member variables indicates multiple responsibilities. Consider splitting such a class up into smaller classes and composing the smaller classes into a container class if it turns out to be appropriate. Often it turns out not to be, the smaller classes really don't have much to do with each other. 

GnuCash's conventional file layout (sadly honored in much in the breach as the observance) is to put the view code in a file pair named after the view, e.g. dialog-commodity.[ch] and the controller/adapter code in a separate file e.g. gnc-commodity-edit.[ch]. Adopting that separation and honoring the spirit would help make your implementation easier to understand.","2022-10-29T20:58:35Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"fellen","MEMBER","I made a test build of a pot file including this assistant and saw a few additional issues, which weblate also would report later similar to https://hosted.weblate.org/translate/gnucash/gnucash/en/?q=has:check.

Some error messages are missing a full stop.
They would also look nicer with a beginning article.

@christopherlam There a still several strange MsgContexts
(in the glade file?) like: 
```
#. Translators: this is a stock transaction describing
#. dividends issued to holder
msgid ""Dividend""
msgstr """"

msgctxt ""Stock Assistant: Action field""
msgid ""Dividend""
msgstr """"

msgid ""Dividend Account""
msgstr """"

msgid ""Dividends""
msgstr """"
```
and
```
msgid ""Fees""
msgstr """"

msgctxt ""Stock Assistant: Action field""
msgid ""Fees""
msgstr """"
```
In text use ` or ` instead of slash like in `received/spent`

`msgid ""No errors found. Click Apply to create transaction.""`
Sentence 1: verb missing;
sentence 2: Quote button labels.
```
#. Translators: this is a stock transaction describing a
#. notional distribution
msgid ""Notional distribution""
```
As first meaning of `Notional` I get `fictitious`. Can we get a better comment?

```
#. Translators: this is a stock transaction describing return
#. of capital
msgid ""Return of capital""
```
This comment has no entropy.

```
#. Translators: this is a stock transaction describing a reverse split
#. Translators: this is a stock transaction describing a
#. reverse split when shorting stock.
msgid ""Reverse split""
```
The first comment would be sufficient.

Another example of a superflous and misleading comment on a general term:
```
#. Translators: this is a stock transaction describing new
#. sale of stock, and recording capital gain/loss

"christopherlam","CONTRIBUTOR","Final comments: I agree it is clever to show negative assets as a negative bar, it may not be strictly legitimate according to formal reporting. Many users are *extremely* sharp as far as accounting standards are concerned, and will ask questions. So, some documentation, including caveats on edge cases, and description how it handles negative amounts, will be crucial for users to understand its behaviour.","2022-02-11T14:26:53Z",false,"APPROVED"

"jralls","MEMBER","Pretty good for a first foray into C++.

The main source of your early problems is not realizing the difference between passing by pointer, reference (a non-nullable pointer), and value. Returning values makes a copy of the return variable so assigning to it or one of its members doesn't change the value in the struct. The beauty of C++'s `&` and `auto` is that you need change only the return type of the accessor function and everything works as references with no copying.

Note that `auto&` works *only* when you're assigning from another variable, not from a function return.

Move semantics can be really complicated but the basic idea is that you're transferring the memory block owned by one variable to another variable instead of copying the contents from one to the other. After a move the donor variable's contents are undefined.

Skipping the GValue dance will hugely speed up KVP access. The example I provided could be made cleaner with some API work on QofInstance and KVP, but that's beyond the scope of this PR. ","2022-01-15T19:25:13Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"jralls","MEMBER","> To do that, we insert transactions one by one into a list, making sure we have not already inserted one that has the same date, and the same absolute amount. 

Too naive, because it's quite possible to have multiple transactions that are identical except for FITID. One example is a visit to the Apple Music store where one might buy several tunes or videos, each of which will appear as a separate line item with the same date, description, and price in the credit card account.

If you pass transactions with more than one target account to the matcher how do you handle reconciliation when there's a balance provided?","2021-10-13T17:27:40Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

I have had a quick look and looks OK to me but I think there is a tree path free missing from gnc_ui_custom_report_edit_name.

As to your Alt-F4, I think you could do the following...

```c
void
custom_report_dialog_destroy_cb (GtkWidget* widget, gpointer data)
{
    CustomReportDialog *crd = data;
    empty_tree_model (gtk_tree_view_get_model(GTK_TREE_VIEW(crd->reportview)));
    g_free (crd);
}

void
custom_report_dialog_close_cb(GtkWidget* widget, gpointer data)
{
    CustomReportDialog *crd = data;
    gnc_save_window_size(GNC_PREFS_GROUP_REPORT_SAVED_CONFIGS, GTK_WINDOW(crd->dialog));
    gtk_widget_destroy (crd->dialog);
}
```
and then connect the 'destroy' signal of the dialog to the destroy function in the glade file.","2021-10-12T16:36:19Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"jralls","MEMBER","This adds a layer of complexity when what's actually required is removing a layer of complexity:

An Account has a split list. `xaccAccountForEachTransaction` traverses the split list and on every split `s` calls the callback with `split->parent`. The original version of `collect_trans_online_id` examined every split in the transaction for an online id and added those splits to the hash. Your change ignores every split in the transaction's split list except the one that belongs to the account. That split is `s`, the one it started with.

A much better fix would just traverse the Account's split list and hash the online ids.","2021-09-05T15:55:29Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","After months I have finally found the time to look at this (and partly prompted because of PR #1247 ).

I think this is generally a very useful step forward. I've added a few remarks.

Considering this PR together with #1247 I am wondering if it would be worth abstracting the design into ""a specialized combobox widget that lists reports and saved reports"" (say `GncReportCombo`) so it could be reused in both use cases.

* This PR is about setting a default (saved) report to use for invoice printing. So it could use that more specialized combo box and build functionality around it to get or set a preference.
* PR #1247 on the other hand is about occasionally using **another** (saved) report to print a certain invoice (without making a detour via an invoice report window). That feature could also benefit from a more specialized combo box and use it to get a one-time value for a one-off (saved) report to use.

This doesn't have to be done as part of this PR necessarily though. I'm fine with the feature as implemented right now already (barring my few comments inline) and I think many users would be quite happy with this improvement.

Working towards a specialized combo box can be done as a next step. The data to store for this particular PR wouldn't change, only the code organisation would. (I'd be much more reluctant if a future adaptation would involve data changes).","2022-01-14T20:07:07Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","I think you have made a good start here. However your initial work reveals much more inconsistencies than just the ones you have uncovered so far. So rather than go through each change you have made, I'll offer a overarching design suggestion to work towards:

### Vendor
![Vendor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/619393/125094594-b091d280-e0d3-11eb-96c8-a16c22d5aa01.png)

#### In the vendor dialog
* Change `Identification` to `Vendor Identification`. That gives enough context to the two enclosed fields we can drop `Vendor` and `Company` from `Number` and `Name` respectively.
* Change to `Vendor Address` instead of `Billing Address`. Vendors only have one address.
* `Payment Information` -> `Billing Information` for the second tab
* `Contact` -> `Contact Name` to clarify this is an optional name for a contact at t his address.

#### In the find  dialog
* Use `Number` and `Name` without their prefixes. From the context it should be clear these refer to the vendor number and name. Benefit of the shorter name will be smaller columns.
* Use `Contact Name` rather than just `Contact` to be consistent with the vendor dialog.

### Customer
![Customer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/619393/125094596-b12a6900-e0d3-11eb-9f23-042bc77daaff.png)

The changes are much like for Vendor. As with vendors, the customer's primary address is called `Customer Address`. Customers however can optionally have a second address, the shipping address. So to disambiguate between the contact names in these two addresses in  the search  form there are `Contact Name` (which refers to the `Customer Address` contact name and `Shipping Contact Name` referring to the contact name on the shipping address.
I have deliberately not chosen `Customer Contact Name` to refer to the `Customer Address` because `Customer` is implied by the way the dialogs are designed now.

### Employee
![Employee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/619393/125094601-b1c2ff80-e0d3-11eb-856b-afd5d0337413.png)

* Again changes similar to the other two, though with a few important distinctions. User name has simply become `Employee Identification` -> `Name`. According to @derekatkins `Username` was chosen with the idea in mind to add fine grained per user access controls to gnucash but that was never implemented. I also think if we ever implement that it should not be at the employee level. So opt here to bring this field in line with the same in vendor and customer. From that follows that the `Employee Address` -> `Name` also becomes the optional `Contact Name` again already in vendor and customer.
* Considering we have no implementation for access control, I also propose to drop the `Access Control` tab completely.
* To be consistent with vendors and customers the order of search parameters and result columns is changed to first show the `Employee Identification`->`Name` and end with `Contact Name`.


All these changes together should give us a more consistent user experience, reusing more terms than before (which means fewer translations), while retaining a space efficient result table.","2021-07-09T15:09:59Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

My immediate remark is this: did you check all of the business code, including the reports if it still works with a missing  customer address ? I *think* there may well be assumptions currently that if the customer exists its address exists as well.","2021-04-10T08:42:15Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"Bob-IT","CONTRIBUTOR","@christopherlam  Looks OK to me.

I had a play with report_id and it sort of worked. The id is saved as part of the open report and can be seen in the .gcm file. But if a report is closed and a new report is opened it would possibly use the same id.

The only way I can think of to make this work is if there were possibly a way to retrieve the budget guid from the report. So one would get a list of open report pages, execute a function against the page that tries to retrieve the budget guid, if successful it then gets compared to the guid in the budget page. In theory the same could happen on invoice pages but with a different function retrieving the invoice guid.

I am not sure it is worth doing but was worth exploring.","2021-03-13T10:32:27Z",false,"APPROVED"

2. remove tooltip capability from `gnc:make-list-option` as well thereby allowing removal of `gnc:option-index-get-description`. The `gnc:make-list-option` is only used in `hello-world.scm` and `average-balance.scm` therefore is not a great loss.

Some deviations from glossary. Translations of split to jako should be changed to rivi. Invoiced should make clear which kind of invoice it is. Transaction to tapahtuma should be changed to tosite.

Selecting:
""year"" as duration, 
""start of last year"" as the start date
""end of current period"" as the end date
and ""never"" for cumulated columns
it should show two columns, but it shows 3 columns with errors in the column headers (I think).

"jralls","MEMBER","There's two more issues:
1. A book with using the equity-type KVP and with opening balance accounts that aren't named Opening Balance in the user's language opened in an older version of GnuCash won't be able to find the right opening balance account so GnuCash will create a new one. We usually handle that with a feature flag and a two-phase introduction: The first phase recognizes the feature flag and can find opening balance accounts using `gnc_account_lookup_by_opening_balance`; the second phase in a later release can set the event-type KVP and the feature flag.
2. A user could rename an opening balance account to something else and not know that they need to set the opening balance flag. The first half of that is an existing problem, but it can be dealt with going forward by noticing the name and setting the flag automatically.","2020-09-18T00:22:43Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"mtalexander","CONTRIBUTOR","After thinking about this, I think that this change is not quite correct.  When the change was made to process multiple files per call, the initialization code for the info struct was lost.  Also the code that does something with created_commodites was lost so it is now leaked.  I think it would be better to remove created_commodites entirely (it never did anything useful) and move the initialization of the other three fields to the top level gnc_file_ofx_import function where the info struct is allocated.  These fields do not need to be initialized for each file, but only once.  Since it is likely that all the files processed in one call are related in some way, it is reasonable to use the same starting point for account selection in the next file.","2020-06-30T22:35:19Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"
"gjanssens","MEMBER","This PR doesn't cover all scenarios with payment transactions very well.

I see three possible scenarios:
1. payment txn has 0 associated invoices yet (a pre-payment)
2. payment txn has exactly one associated invoice
3. payment txn has more than one associated invoice

Each case has different behaviour:
1. The menu option should be disabled. There's nothing useful to show so don't offer the option.
2. Find the invoice and show it. This is regardless of whether the invoice is associated with the current split or any other split in the transaction. To find it there are a few mechanisms. The universal one is to loop over all APAR splits until you find one with an associated invoice. For invoice type txns a shortcut is to query the transaction itself for its associated invoice. I don't know if that optimization is still worth it.
3. The basic idea is to ask the user which invoice to display. You could still refine this and alter behaviour in case the split you clicked on for this action has an associated invoice itself. This is more or less what you have implemented now. I'm in two minds whether this specialization is really beneficial or rather confusing. It's much easier to educate users on the concept of the three rules above than having to explain why sometimes you can't select the invoice to jump to for multi-invoice payments and sometimes you can.

Anyway, much of the code will revolve around counting invoices in a transaction and determining the behaviour based on whether the number of invoices is 0, 1 or > 1.","2020-07-02T08:12:20Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

The contents of gnucash.pot is identical before and after applying this PR.
And running this on an installation with guile 2.2 message translations for guile code are found properly. I can't test with guile 3 atm as I don't have an installation with that version.

I'm inclined to apply it for 4.0 still (it won't break string freeze), but this may have to be discussed first.","2020-06-15T07:53:55Z",false,"APPROVED"

"jralls","MEMBER","There's no need to have separate C and C++ wrappers, you can simply make the whole thing gnucash-core.cpp. SWIG is smart enough to deal with both. You can look at the SWIG parts of [my c++options](https://github.com/jralls/gnucash/tree/c%2B%2Boptions/libgnucash/app-utils) branch, in particular [this commit](https://github.com/jralls/gnucash/commit/9fc3e848d0dbc7de64343fee17245e4c6fc52375), for an example.

I'm not convinced that automatically determining whether to set `-c++` based on the output file extension is a good idea; I am sure that basing it on the last characters of a variable name is not. But a simple wrapper function something like
```
macro (gnc_add_swig_c++_python_command _target _out_var _output _input _include_dirs)
    set(SWIG_ARGS ""-c++"" ""-procdoc"" ""sw-gnc-option-doc"" ""-procdocformat"" ""plain"")
    gnc_add_swig_python_command(_target _out_var _output _input _include_dirs)
    unset(SWIG_ARGS)
endmacro()
```
might be easier to understand.","2020-06-14T01:27:35Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"jeanlaroche","CONTRIBUTOR","> @jeanlaroche Could you look at changing this ?

Sure! But notice that I believe aqbanking does exactly the same thing (pop the reconcile dialog before the transaction matching is done). I do agree that that does not make a lot of sense.
Bob, since you're looking at this, I suspect a difficulty: The match dialog call returns immediately (it's non-modal) so how do you suggest I pop the reconcile dialog *after* the matching is done? 
The only solution I can see is to add the reconcile info (account, balance, date) to the matching dialog call (as a parameter, probably a structure, or a list of structures since we can have several accounts to reconcile) indicating ""open the reconcile when you're done"". But that's a rather pervasive change.
Can you think of anything better?
Thanks!","2020-04-27T15:58:20Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","Generally looks good to me.

While reviewing I couldn't help thinking it would be good user experience if the OFX importer was transformed into an assistant as the csv importer. The current importer does everything in separate windows that close and open. The steps are similar:
1. select a file or multiple files to import
2. (csv needs a preview step, but can be skipped for ofx)
3. account name matching step
4. transaction matching step
5. summary

Your use case of processing multiple files in sequence can also be handled more elegantly with an assistant: for each file you do step 3 and 4. At the end of each step 4 you test whether there's still another file waiting. If so, jump back to step 3 with the new file. Or you could parse all files for unknown accounts in one go, offer step 3 only once and then repeat step 4 for each ofx file (even more elegant IMO, but perhaps not easy with libofx). Just a suggestion for future improvement.","2020-05-14T08:44:44Z",false,"DISMISSED"

"derekatkins","CONTRIBUTOR","HI.
I think there is a small problem here in that you're not actually specifying the date that the balance is computed.  Specifically, the balance will be computed at the end of time, which might not be the ""right"" balance.  This is a problem in multiple ways:
1) If there are multiple SXes that fire, are you sure they are being inserted in order?  For example, let's say that the user went away for 3 months so has 3 mortgage payments fire simultaneously.  The first one might have the correct balance, but the next two probably wont.
2) If you're dealing with an asset account that has multiple transactions going, the way the balance is computed probably wont be correct, either.

In my mind the correct function to use is xaccAccountGetBalanceAsOfDate(), but then you need to ensure you plug in the correct date.  Also, you need to deal with the case of multiple-firing instances of SXes too.","2020-04-06T19:51:48Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","Good you are working on this. The current state handling is a bit frustrating at times.

You bring up a good point with the default state for invoices and bills and I like to go a bit deeper into that.

With your additions we now save state for account registers, invoice windows and budgets.

Let's start with invoices and bills. There are 3 layouts really, invoice layout, bill layout and voucher layout. We also support credit notes but these just use the same respective layouts per type. Each of these layouts has a fixed number of columns which can't be changed.
Of all the fields, only the Description field can vary widely in content width. The others a few characters at most. I will assume that if a user changes any column other than the description column, chances are high this is because the current defaults aren't good - a date, amount, total,... doesn't fit due to particular font or style settings. On the other hand if the user changes the Description that may be because it doesn't fit too well for a particular document. I believe the former is much more likely than the latter.

Where I'm going with this is should we consider only allowing the user to save an updated default state rather than individual document states ?
Here is what I would propose for invoices, bills, etc:
* Add a menu item to set default state (you did). If the user clicks that, the state of the current document will be stored as default state and reused for all documents of the same type that will be opened subsequently. This will help in cases where a field is systematically too narrow or too wide.
* For the description use case (where it's too wide or narrow on a particular document) I would propose to save state of open documents separately. We already do so. There's a page group for each open document. In there we add the current column widths. That means the state will be lost when the user closes the document, but at the same time it will be saved across gnucash restarts. This is a different trade-off to guard against an exploding state file than yours (which was to drop state for paid documents). I think saving individual state on not currently opened invoices only for a description field that may or may not be too wide is a bit overkill. I'll go even further in that if it's too long to fit completely, in most cases the part that is visible will already hold enough information to understand what the entry was about. So showing the complete field is rarely needed.
* Have a menu item to reset the default state to built-in state.

And I'm actually inclined to apply the same reasoning to the account registers. The most common motivation to change field widths is a field that's systematically too narrow. So implementing defaults for registers would make a lot of sense. We should keep in mind though there are several register types with a varying number of columns. Of the top of my head there are at least
- the most basic register (denominated in a currency)
- a commodity register (which will has amount, price and share price fields)
- a business register (which will have a type field)
- a general ledger (though that may just be a variation of the ordinary register with detailed split view)
- ...
 So we'd need to save different defaults per register type. Other than that it can follow the same concept.

FWIW I used to compare gnucash with a spreadsheet when thinking of how to handle columns. There is a difference though: spreadsheets are completely free-form grids of cells. What information goes into which column can vary arbitrarily from page (tab) to page (tab). That doesn't apply to gnucash. The columns are strictly defined and the information presented in pages of the same type is very similar. In addition a spreadsheet typically only has a handful of tabs (or sheets) at most. However gnucash keeps track of hundreds of objects that can all be represented in a tab. So where in a spreadsheet it would make sense to store column information for each sheet (tab), it does much less so for gnucash IMO. Hence my strong preference to move to defaults per supported type.","2020-02-18T17:15:06Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Unfortunately there are a few issues with it as well. You'll find comments for a few minor technical issues interleaved in the code.

The bigger issue is however the translation issues your parameterized strings introduce. @jralls already alluded to these on IRC. I have pointed out a few cases in your code that effectively result in strings that can't be translated in all languages. Personally I don't think there's a universal solution to this using parameterized strings. While that would have allowed us to reuse a few shorter string translations we will always end up with grammatical issues in other languages. So we probably need to use full strings after all. That means more translation work, but at least they will be translatable in all cases. And it allows each language to properly set the key binding as is best suited in that language.","2019-10-25T20:13:59Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","The  end result looks good now. As a final step before merging the PR, now is the moment to reorganize your commits to clean up the story they tell.
For example you can squash commits 3,4,6, part of 7 and 9 into one commit. As this resulting commit is fixing a bug, the first line of the commit message should be
Bug <number> - <bug title>
More details can be added in subsequent commit message lines if desired.
""Part of 7"" refers to the bits of that commit that fix the build errors of commit 6. We aim to merge only commits that pass tests to simplify bisecting in the future. In the rare occasions where this is not possible, it should be clearly indicated in the commit message. That's not the case here though.
The other commits stand sufficiently on their own IMO and can be reused as they are.
Reordering and sqashing your commits can be done with `git rebase -i ...`
Splitting up commit 7 is a bit more tricky. If you find that too advanced, I'm fine with squashing the complete commit 7 with the others, and adding a note about the removed list counts in the commit message.","2019-11-10T14:35:05Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","Aside from the technical suggestions there are a few design issues though - backward compatibility and user experience

First on the backward compatibility. Our policy so far has been that any data format change in a major release should be accompanied with changes in the most recent stable release in a way that that most recent stable release can at least still read the new format. It may not be able to write the new format, but it should be capable of reading the new format and writing the old format. With this ""one time budget sign fix"" we're in a bit of an awkward situation as it affects both data and reports together.

Assuming 3.8 is the most recent stable version that should be able to read the new budget data format, that would mean that version should be able to read both the old and the new format:
* users may be using 3.7 on other PC's and 3.8 should work well with that data.
* or users may be using 4.0 on another PC and 3.8 should be able to interpret 4.x's data correctly.

So 3.8 needs a way to determine which data format it's looking at and act accordingly. We can use your newly added feature check `GNC_FEATURE_BUDGET_UNREVERSED` to make this distinction. But contrary to what you did that means 3.8 should be made aware of this flag so it should already be defined in 3.8. The clever trick lies in the fact the 3.x series will *never* actively set that flag. Only 4.x will. That will ensure that once 4.x converts the data, gnucash versions older than 3.7 will refuse to work on that data. 3.8 and up on the other hand will, and can use the presence of the flag to determine how to interpret the budget data.

If the flag is unset, treat the data as old style (with fragile sign reversals) and handle it accordingly in reports. If the flag is set, handle the data as new style (with canonical data stored) and handle sign reversals only while displaying.

It gets a bit more complicated when users manipulate budget data in 3.8 after it had been converted to new style. Conceptually the budget data is supposed to be written back in the old format (3.8 should only be able to read the new format, remember?). We could do that in theory, provided the feature flag is reset when that happens. In practice though I think this will be fairly complex. When exactly do you change from one format to the other ? The moment the user enters a new value in the budget ? When the data is saved again ? In all situations it will be tricky to make all parts of the code switch at the same time from one format to the other. I think it to more elegant to decide the format at load time and stick to it (either after an initial conversion as 4.x does or just using it as is in 3.x).
The side effect of that choice would be that 3.8 should be capable of both reading and writing old and new formats *and* the reports should be able to display either format.

Aiming for backwards compatibility is a bitch unfortunately...


The second bit is user experience:

The backwards compatibility is one important aspect of this already of course.

Here are just a few other smaller considerations:

You have already determined two use cases in which the conversion should not be run:
- If it's already set
- If the book doesn't contain any budgets
There's a third case: when the user isn't reverting accounts at all. In the case we can assume all amounts are already stored properly. Rather than running over each account with the function gnc_reverse_balance to find one, you can simply check whether the user's preference is set to a value that reverses certain accounts. That's roughly the same check gnc_reverse_balance does as well, only more direct.

Next, the message provided to the user should be more elaborate. I think it should at least inform the user the old style data format was fragile wrt the account reversals necessitating a one-time fix. And it should make it clear that after applying the fix the data can't be opened anymore with versions of gnucash older the 3.8 (or whatever the first version will be that will be able to handle the new format).

And then there are more subtle issues:
- assume a user opens a pre-existing book that doesn't have any budgets yet in 4.x. Your current check will detect this and just skip any conversion attempt (and hence won't set the feature flag). The user now adds a budget (still in 4.x) and saves the book. Next restart gnucash. It will arrive again at this conversion check. The flag is not set, and at least one budget is present, so the conversion function is triggered. This is not what you want! The book was saved with gnucash 4.x so the budget values were already in the correct format and will now be inverted! To fix: the feature flag should also be set on save when the book contains at least one budget.
- a variation based one the third option: there are no reversed account because the user preference dictated this. Assuming this third test is added, opening this book in 4.x will skip conversion. At some point the user decides s/he prefers to use an account reversal strategy after all and changes the preference. Upon first opening the book again in 4.x the conversion will run as the flag was not set. You could argue this wouldn't happen if we just run the conversion at all times, regardless of the user's chosen account reversal strategy. That's right, however that would also mean that in many cases we prevent users from using an older version of gnucash that could before even though the data hasn't changed. So instead I would set or reset the feature flag whenever the user changes the account reversal strategy. If there are no account reversals reset the flag, otherwise set it.

Note the check for sign reverted accounts as third check assumes the user could have been sensibly using budgets with that user preference set in 3.x. I'm not sure that was actually the case as I haven't tested this. The above concept may need a few slight tweaks depending on the current state of budget issues in the 3.x series.","2019-10-17T19:58:04Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Line 2 is a duplication of line 4;

translator-credits: There is no need to translate ""translator-credits""  as the section already gets prefixed by a translated string of ""Translation:"", but you should keep the history by appending a line ""2006 Ori Hoch ..."";

Line 4396: There is no file with name ""צלמית גנוקאש"" in our repository. just keep ""gnucash-icon"". Other projects can have ""app-icon-en"", ""app-icon-de"", ""app-icon-he"" ..., but we have only one icon.

in  msgid's of the form ""sample:`<some non empty pattern>`"" do not translate ""sample:"", but adjust the rest. This strings are used to determinate the wide of the columns or input fields.

21  msgstr's lack the keyboard accelerator mark '_', run 
`msgfmt -c --check-accelerators=""_"" he.po`
to find them.

At the end of the file you can remove the obsolete messages marked with #~ 
They are no longer in use.

Can you apply the changes?

A few notes:
1. For each task create a new PR, in this case, one for the po file and another for the templates.

2. For each pull request create a new branch, based on the recent version of the origins target branch.
Your current branch dates back to march and does not contain the update where I merged new strings into the file (commit 942e74).

msgfmt: found 22 fatal errors

Despite msgfmt says ""fatal"" it  is not. Do you want to add mnemonics?

I will remove the old, wrong gnucash.po, which somehow managed to reappear in your commit.

msgid ""translator-credits"": You should also mention the previous translator:
""...\n
Avi ..., 2019\n
Ori ..., 2008""

I am pretty sure, in cases where the string contains a colon "":"" and probably a variable, i.e. ""~a"", we got it not everywhere in the right direction. You should run i.e. tomorrows nightly and create a) a PR with fixes of your mistakes and b) report strings, which we should change.

Bug 797348 - Wrong column order for RTL writing in GUI elements
and long before
Bug 720299 - Review of compounded messages under the aspect of right-to-left written languages

"jralls","MEMBER","Looks generally OK, though I'm not keen on inlining large functions into other large functions to make even larger functions: It's a serious hit on readability and ability to locally reason about the code. I called out one instance as an example.

I'm assuming that in your zeal to replace `gnc-numeric` calls you're taking care to ensure that all scheme numbers are exact and stay that way.

Are you sure that looking at both AR and AP for all flavors of the report is the right thing to do? As long as the books are correct it should be just wasted time producing no results to search for Customer transactions in AP or Vendor ones in AR. I guess if the books *aren't* correct then having the report show the misplaced transactions would be helpful.

There are a few points that need attention - see my review comments inline.

I am not too happy with the choice for kvp, but I understand the reasoning. I was also triggered by the use of a hierarchical kvp as it's a performance killer. But given the rest of the budgetting code uses hierarchical kvp's as well, I will accept that's the best choice now and until we really refactor the internal data structure.","2019-06-04T12:39:24Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","While I agree there are situations in which it's useful to know these version details in the python bindings, I also think it would be good to define the api directly in the gnucash C(++) code and expose that api instead.

This is most obvious for GNUCASH_BUILD_ID. That constant is currently used in two locations in the sources. In both cases it's used as is if it is not empty or replaced by the same default if it is empty. This risks getting out of sync if one wants to update the defautl, but forgets to change it in both locations. In principle the bindings are supposed to use the string in the same way again, which increases this risk of inconsistent use as each location has to do ""the same thing"".

I have quickly looked over the code and I propose to incorporate this in what is now gnc-version.h. That is currently an auto-generated file. However I think it could be added as a fixed header file (with associated *.c file) in which we expose the functions as you have added in the gnucash_core.i file. Most functions can be exactly what you have created here. Only gnc_build_id should do the conditional stuff to return a common default if the constant is empty.","2019-02-21T11:13:10Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

However as I already suggested in your previous PR, it should have been multiple commits instead of everything squashed into one. There are 8 bugs and only one commit. That makes it very hard to figure out which changes were done for which purpose. That goes for all of us that didn't write this patch and also for your future self if you look back in a couple of years.

Please rework this PR and split it up in separate commits for each bug report. Note that each commit should stand on its own in the sense that each commit should be compilable and not break functionality. Note it's to avoid this kind of extra work I had asked in one of the bug reports to show your work as early as possible...","2019-01-20T11:06:56Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Can you rebase your branch on current maint and then force push to your github repo to update this PR ?

As to your questions:
- if 35 handlers are left in the hash table that means indeed some gui objects are not properly cleaning up after themselves. So yes, please track those down and add the proper disconnect functions in the object destructors.
- and the hash table should in theory be explicitly destroyed. However considering it's static, there will only ever be one and hence the memory leak would be minimal. It would have to happen on destruction of the GSettings backend, or on gnc_gsettings_unload_backend. But we don't have such a function (yet) so I can live with this minimal memory leak. The fact 35 signal handlers remain registered is a much more important leak which may lead to increased memory usage if gnucash is kept open for long times. So focus on that part first. You can search for all uses of gnc_settings_register_cb and check if the proper unregister equivalent is really called.","2018-09-24T16:13:48Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

I think though the root cause is an inconsistency in our default CXX_FLAGS versus our C_FLAGS. The latter already includes -Wno-deprecated-declarations while the former doesn't. I would suggest to make this consistent.

"gjanssens","MEMBER","I think your fix will work.

On the other hand I think the original code was a rather inefficient. That is to say I don't think basing a strategy on row number is a good strategy.

While you're in this area, can you improve the function to use report guids to manage the list of available reports instead of the detour via position in the list ?

I think that would reduce the number of round trips to scheme code making the code more readable *and* faster.

Regardless of guids vs row numbers (which I'll detail below), there's also no need to track selected lines. This information is readily available from the treeviews, at least until the tree models are cleared. So the functions related to tracking the selection can be removed and I suspect your first_run boolean can be replaced with whether you managed to extract a valid selection from the treeview (in row counting terms, set row to -1 to start, try to get the row number stored in the tree selection and check if this is still a valid number, if not set it to -1, then your selection loop should only run if selection is > -1. A similar strategy can be set up when using guids).

The guid story is that you store report guids (probably still most efficiently in SCM format) instead of row numbers in the tree store. With the changes as above you can start by extracting a guid from the existing tree selection. If there isn't one , set selection to SCM_UNDEFINED.

Then you rebuild the list store. For each line you add you can check that line's guid against your selection one. If it matches that's the line to select at some point (either directly or in a followup loop, see inline comment on this idea).

I think this slightly reduces the number or scm callouts.

Ideally this would also be done for the content liststore, but that may be a bit more tricky as it involves changing the options internals to return a list of guids instead of a list of line numbers (although perhaps there is a function that would do so. I haven't checked that part).","2018-08-07T16:01:05Z",false,"COMMENTED"
"gjanssens","MEMBER","The guid based approach looks good. And I am fine with skipping the content tree view. It's tricky.

As for the different names this comes from the fact that the available reports list and the content reports list use a different source to extract the name: the former uses the report name while the latter uses the report's ""name"" option. The first can be altered in the saved report configurations window, the latter in the report options. We should align these and I'll see if I can find a way to extract the former from the report options as well.","2018-08-08T18:12:52Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

It includes using a fixture and two layers of test-path. It all passes now, but here's what part of the output looked like when a test failed:
```
[pass] line:461, test: AAPL latest
[pass] line:464, test: MSFT latest
[fail] line:467, test: IBM latest

Note that as long as the test passes it just gives the name from the test-assert (or in this case, test-equal), but if there's a failure it follows that with the test-begin names separated by forward slashes. test-equal, test-eq, and test-eqv are nice because they also tell you what you wanted and what you got, while test-assert just fails so you have to add a detail message yourself.","2018-08-27T23:11:25Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","More in general though I wonder whether a dialog (now turned window) is really the best design choice for the function it fulfils. Perhaps I don't see all the use cases though so feel free to correct me.

The main use case I see is you can search for an account by typing part of the name to get a shorter list and then jump to that account. However one can directly type (part of) an account name when the account hierarchy is the front most window/page and it does this for you. If the text you typed is not unique you can use arrow up and arrow down to jump to the previous/next account that matches.

This is much faster and with much less user interruption.
The main drawback of this treeview feature is discoverability, which could be improved by adding a looking-glass type button in a carefully chosen spot.

The current find account window also presents additional booleans for the accounts, namely placeholder, hidden, unused, zero balance or tax related. Except for the hidden status, all the other could in some way be represented directly on the main account page in my opinion by playing with font style (for placeholder) or extra optional columns (unused, tax related). Zero balance is already visible.

As with the reconcile view suggestions I made, this is not something to consider for the 3.x series. But I would love to discuss this further at some point for 4.x.","2018-07-31T12:22:59Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","About commit 2e4895d4c7cc0579582c59c8d579bb17835075e2:
If I understand you correctly you're replacing tests for the old api with tests for the new api. I'd prefer to see tests *added* instead of replaced.
Only when the old api is dropped the accompanying tests should be replaced.
This has a few benefits:
* the old tests can help catch regressions in the api conversion layers
* they equally can catch regressions if we still have to apply bug fixes to the old api code itself before it gets finally dropped.

Lastly, should this commit not be added *after* the new html-chart api is added ? In other words, shouldn't it be swapped with the next commit ?","2018-11-05T19:55:49Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","When making changes which are associated to a bug report please use the bug report id and title as first line of the commit message. More details can be added starting from the third line.

Doing this has a few benefits: 
1. the one pushing your changes knows a bug has to be closed as well (and when git-bz is installed, this can be handled automatically even).
2. it's easier to scan for fixed bugs when generating a release

I usually use the bug id and title exactly as shown in bugzilla (I actually even copy it straight from the grey title area of the bug report itself). For this particular case that would be

The new directory needs respective  `*make* `files and be mentioned in the level above `*make*` files.

"gjanssens","MEMBER","Here are a first few review comments/questions.

On a general note, I'm in two minds about your first two commits. While I do like the pervasive code reuse you manage there, I'm not sure It's done the right way.

You have now created an asymmetry between the transaction report (the base) and the GST report (the derived one). Because of this you have to tweak the the options you get from the transaction report in several non-obvious ways.

Can you instead abstract the common code into a common base object (""trans-report-base"" for lack of a more inspired name)? This base just implements what's common in both reports. Then both reports derive from this and add their own unique options to it. That's cleaner OO design IMO, because it's now clear there's a base class for both and everything in that base class is valid for both.","2018-02-04T14:26:07Z",false,"COMMENTED"

- When the primary sort key is not set to an account related value, the two checkboxes at the bottom are disabled. However they remain disabled if the second sort key is set to an account related value. Wouldn't you want the same flexibility for both options ?

- When opening the Report Options dialog for newly opened transaction report (so with default options set) the Display tab will show ""Account Name"" and ""Use Full Account Name"" as ticked. That's good. However ""Other Account Name"" is not ticked and still ""Use Other Full Account Name"" is enabled (and ticked).

- Closing and Reopening the Report Options dialog will spew lots of errors like this one:

Other than the comments you will find inline, I would add

- you can squash the whitespace correcting commits all into one.
- compared to the gtk2 version of the register a highlighted text is difficult to read because the selection box (in blue on my system) is drawn much tighter around the highlighted text. Ideally I would like to see this highlighting rect to be as high as the full transaction/line height, minus one px of yellow above and below.
- when running gnucash I see warnings like this on the debug output: ```Gtk-WARNING **: Theme parsing error: gnucash.css:44:25: The :insensitive pseudo-class is deprecated. Use :disabled instead.```
- the transfer account pop-up list will not close by clicking outside of it. It will only close by switching cells by keyboard navigation or by clicking the pop-down arrow again.

Some of the changes I suggested can be done in a follow up branch. I would like to get most of what is here merged in before 2.7 is released as it's a big improvement already. To get there can you
1. rebase on current unstable
2. squash the whitespace fixing commits together
3. force-push your branch

"gjanssens","MEMBER","Christopher, while I see value in this extra filter, you patch will need additional work because it may lead to incompatible saved reports state.

When someone saves a report based on your change with the ""Account substring"" option set and later wants to reopen it with an older version of gnucash (be it on another PC or because the current version is causing trouble), gnucash will fail to load the saved report due to an unknown option.

For this reason incompatible option changes

1. can only be done on master
2. backward compatibility code should be added to maint

The first part is a matter of applying your changes to the master branch and making a PR to master.
The second part means in addition to the master work, you'll need to add a PR to maint such that maint is aware of the new option. Maint may choose not to use the option, but it should resave it when set.","2017-08-19T10:36:35Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"gjanssens","MEMBER","It looks like the GncPriceImport class is very similar to GncTxImport. I hoped my code would be reusable :)

However also here I would like a similar solution to GncImportSettings: create a base class with 2 derived classes.

The reason I would like to see this is that both classes share quite a bit of functionality, like setting file format, encoding. Other methods have the same intention but only work on different data. Or in other words both classes have a very similar interface.

By copying the file, you only make a snapshot of the interface and common functionality. If either class then makes changes in what could be common code or interface the other won't pick it up. So the classes would unintentionally drift apart over time. This risk is much less by explicitly writing it in code the classes adhere a common interface and by keeping common code written only once","2017-12-08T19:12:23Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"
"gjanssens","MEMBER","Bob, your rework of the CsvImportSettings classes is a very good start. Looking at your work triggered a lot of further design improvements still.  The import interface is still evolving as it grows and the extensions you have added were not always considered in my first idea. So I hope you bear with me in the comments I have added.

A more general remark, I think it's worth renaming a number of files and classes to be more unified, starting with the settings classes. I propose to use file names like this:
gnc-imp-settings-<filetype>-<objecttype>.<ext>
So
gnc-imp-settings-csv-trans.cpp, gnc-imp-settings-csv.hpp (for the base class) and so on.
That will group the related source files closer together in the file browser.
And let's use similar names for the classes:
GncImpSettingsCsv, GncImpSettingsCsvTrans, GncImpSettingsCsvPrice

Be sure to do the renaming in a separate commit though.","2017-12-24T14:54:14Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Yet I can't apply it as is unfortunately.
First reason is it introduces new, translatable strings in the tax report. And our policy says such changes should go on the master branch.

So i tried to apply your patch against the master branch to be able to pull it in without you having to do additional work. Unfortunately that results in a merge conflict because master already has conflicting changes in taxinvoice.eguile.scm.

The conflict is in your change from

`(each      (gncEntryGetInvPrice entry))`

to

`(each      (if opt-netprice (gncEntryGetInvNetPrice entry) (gncEntryGetInvPrice entry)))`

On master this line has been changed already to allow the taxinvoice to be used for vendor bills as well as for customer invoices.

However this is still a PR against the maint branch. I don't intend to apply this to maint because it

- is an enchancement rather than a bug fix
- introduces new translatable strings
- will cause merge conflicts when merging to master

That's too many issues to go on maint.

Regarding the PR as a whole there's one more detail to care about in future requests: it's not a good idea to merge the maint branch into your feature branch. This risks ending up with missing changes at some point in the future. Merging should only happen ""upwards"", that is from feature branches to integration branches (like maint and master).

"jralls","MEMBER","@RaianRaika,

The implementation in gnc-date and gnc-datetime is backwards. Implement everything in **C++11** using a class hierarchy to provide calendar classes. Renam GncDateTimeImpl to GncGregorian create a new GncJalali subclass of GncDateTime. Provide a factory function that picks which one to instantiate based on the preference setting. gnc-jalali.h/c should be changed to gnc-jalali.hpp/cpp and should implement the GncJalali calendar class, using whatever of Christian’s old code that  you like, but translated into C++.

 The whole thing should be completely invisible to the C functions in gnc-date.cpp; gdate-utils will have to be converted to C++ (it can move to libqof too) so that it can call GncDateTime to do what it needs, and that will fix the problem of OS-provided date functions. We can't use them because 32-bit and LLP64 systems have a 32-bit time_t that fails for dates after mid-2038. gnc-date's time64 exists purely to work around that, but in GncJalali you can use boost::datetime directly.

Then there's GncCalendar. Rather than copying the whole thing into GnuCash, you should subclass GtkCalendar and override only the functions that you need to.

Aside from the design problem, some general issues:

Please reformat your code to meet our [coding standards](http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/CodingStandard). You may find [artistic style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) helpful; we use ```astyle --indent=spaces=4 --brackets=break --suffix=none``` that cleans up most of the problems.

Block comments should be enclosed with ```/* … */```; ```/**…*/``` for Doxygen comments.

You declare ```static``` functions in header files. That’s a major no-no. ```static``` functions have scope only in the file they’re defined in.","2017-02-04T23:35:09Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"
