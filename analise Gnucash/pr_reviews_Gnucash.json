We're trying to reduce our dependencies on GLib, particularly in C++ code, so I'd prefer not to use G_BEGIN/END_DECLS macros. One alternative would be to recreate them with GNC_BEGIN/END_DECLS, but that would require having a common header that gets included everywhere and we don't have one of those and it seems silly to introduce one just for a single macro pair. The other alternative is to replace the macros with their expansion, i.e. `G_BEGIN_DECLS` with `#ifdef __cplusplus…`.

C++ classes should each [do a single job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) and should present a functional interface that performs the job, not be a bundle of variables. When you want a bundle of variables use a struct *with no functions*.\r\n\r\nModel, View, and Controller are categories for classes; they should be single classes only in the simplest designs. For example instead of a single StockAssistantView class you might have a class for each page in the assistant and each page class might have its own controller; see the next item.\r\n\r\nNote that in the original [MVC design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) the view was the display driver and the controller was the keyboard driver. Modern GUI frameworks like Gtk handle both ends of that, so a more useful way to think of the separation in GnuCash terms is that the View is what Gtk does, the Model is what's in the Engine, and the Controller is whatever (ideally minimal) code is needed in between. This is sometimes called [Model-View-Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–adapter). In practice with Gtk the View classes would contain the Gtk-dependent code and provide an abstracted interface through which the controller could get and set widget values and register signal handlers. The model lives lilbgnucash, and the controller uses the libgnucash API to manipulate data in response to the inputs or to retrieve data to display in the view.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Gtk itself has its own class hierarchy and memory management system. You want only the thinnest possible C++ wrapper or none at all. Note that a GObject* is already a reference-counted shared pointer. C++ std::shared_ptr and std::unique_ptr require destructor parameters to work correctly with them.\r\n\r\nCombining declarations and function implementations the way you have is incredibly hard to read. It's suitable only for simple classes with a few short member functions where short means no more than 3 lines and a few means no more than 5.\r\n\r\nHuge classes with more than a dozen or so member variables indicates multiple responsibilities. Consider splitting such a class up into smaller classes and composing the smaller classes into a container class if it turns out to be appropriate. Often it turns out not to be, the smaller classes really don't have much to do with each other. \r\n\r\nGnuCash's conventional file layout (sadly honored in much in the breach as the observance) is to put the view code in a file pair named after the view, e.g. dialog-commodity.[ch] and the controller/adapter code in a separate file e.g. gnc-commodity-edit.[ch]. Adopting that separation and honoring the spirit would help make your implementation easier to understand.","submittedAt":"2022-10-29T20:58:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-10-30T05:19:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-10-30T05:20:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-10-30T18:48:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-10-30T18:59:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-03-08T16:07:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-06-11T20:07:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"fellen"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Nice improvement.\r\n\r\n@christopherlam As long as the wrong MsgContexts are not  removed, we have set assistant-stock-transaction.* on xgettext's ignore list.

Returning values makes a copy of the return variable so assigning to it or one of its members doesn't change the value in the struct. The beauty of C++'s `&` and `auto` is that you need change only the return type of the accessor function and everything works as references with no copying.\r\n\r\nNote that `auto&` works *only* when you're assigning from another variable, not from a function return.\r\n\r\nMove semantics can be really complicated but the basic idea is that you're transferring the memory block owned by one variable to another variable instead of copying the contents from one to the other. After a move the donor variable's contents are undefined.\r\n\r\nSkipping the GValue dance will hugely speed up KVP access. The example I provided could be made cleaner with some API work on QofInstance and KVP, but that's beyond the scope of this PR.

One example is a visit to the Apple Music store where one might buy several tunes or videos, each of which will appear as a separate line item with the same date, description, and price in the credit card account.\r\n\r\nIf you pass transactions with more than one target account to the matcher how do you handle reconciliation when there's a balance provided?","submittedAt":"2021-10-13T17:27:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-13T17:31:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-14T06:29:56Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-14T15:49:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-14T17:48:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-14T18:28:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-15T00:31:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-15T01:16:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-15T08:34:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-15T13:09:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-15T15:47:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-15T19:11:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-16T02:39:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-16T08:49:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-16T16:37:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-17T03:58:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-18T00:42:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-18T03:55:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-18T15:46:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-18T17:19:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-10-18T18:10:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One last thing I've noticed while testing ofx imports... while `Cancel` is handled appropriately (i.e. we're not ready to import ofx), ESC wasn't being handled well and was leaving the register rather dirty with dangling splits everywhere.

I've added a few remarks.\r\n\r\nConsidering this PR together with #1247 I am wondering if it would be worth abstracting the design into \"a specialized combobox widget that lists reports and saved reports\" (say `GncReportCombo`) so it could be reused in both use cases.\r\n\r\n* This PR is about setting a default (saved) report to use for invoice printing. So it could use that more specialized combo box and build functionality around it to get or set a preference.\r\n* PR #1247 on the other hand is about occasionally using **another** (saved) report to print a certain invoice (without making a detour via an invoice report window). That feature could also benefit from a more specialized combo box and use it to get a one-time value for a one-off (saved) report to use.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't have to be done as part of this PR necessarily though. I'm fine with the feature as implemented right now already (barring my few comments inline) and I think many users would be quite happy with this improvement.\r\n\r\nWorking towards a specialized combo box can be done as a next step. The data to store for this particular PR wouldn't change, only the code organisation would.

However your initial work reveals much more inconsistencies than just the ones you have uncovered so far. So rather than go through each change you have made, I'll offer a overarching design suggestion to work towards:\r\n\r\n### Vendor\r\n![Vendor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/619393/125094594-b091d280-e0d3-11eb-96c8-a16c22d5aa01.png)\r\n\r\n#### In the vendor dialog\r\n* Change `Identification` to `Vendor Identification`. That gives enough context to the two enclosed fields we can drop `Vendor` and `Company` from `Number` and `Name` respectively.\r\n* Change to `Vendor Address` instead of `Billing Address`. Vendors only have one address.\r\n* `Payment Information` -> `Billing Information` for the second tab\r\n* `Contact` -> `Contact Name` to clarify this is an optional name for a contact at t his address.\r\n\r\n#### In the find  dialog\r\n* Use `Number` and `Name` without their prefixes. From the context it should be clear these refer to the vendor number and name. Benefit of the shorter name will be smaller columns.\r\n* Use `Contact Name` rather than just `Contact` to be consistent with the vendor dialog.\r\n\r\n### Customer\r\n![Customer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/619393/125094596-b12a6900-e0d3-11eb-9f23-042bc77daaff.png)\r\n\r\nThe changes are much like for Vendor. As with vendors, the customer's primary address is called `Customer Address`. Customers however can optionally have a second address, the shipping address. So to disambiguate between the contact names in these two addresses in  the search  form there are `Contact Name` (which refers to the `Customer Address` contact name and `Shipping Contact Name` referring to the contact name on the shipping address.\r\nI have deliberately not chosen `Customer Contact Name` to refer to the `Customer Address` because `Customer` is implied by the way the dialogs are designed now.\r\n\r\n### Employee\r\n![Employee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/619393/125094601-b1c2ff80-e0d3-11eb-856b-afd5d0337413.png)\r\n\r\n* Again changes similar to the other two, though with a few important distinctions. User name has simply become `Employee Identification` -> `Name`. According to @derekatkins `Username` was chosen with the idea in mind to add fine grained per user access controls to gnucash but that was never implemented. I also think if we ever implement that it should not be at the employee level. So opt here to bring this field in line with the same in vendor and customer. From that follows that the `Employee Address` -> `Name` also becomes the optional `Contact Name` again already in vendor and customer.\r\n* Considering we have no implementation for access control, I also propose to drop the `Access Control` tab completely.\r\n* To be consistent with vendors and customers the order of search parameters and result columns is changed to first show the `Employee

I think it would be better to remove created_commodites entirely (it never did anything useful) and move the initialization of the other three fields to the top level gnc_file_ofx_import function where the info struct is allocated.

The menu option should be disabled. There's nothing useful to show so don't offer the option.\r\n2. Find the invoice and show it. This is regardless of whether the invoice is associated with the current split or any other split in the transaction. To find it there are a few mechanisms. The universal one is to loop over all APAR splits until you find one with an associated invoice. For invoice type txns a shortcut is to query the transaction itself for its associated invoice. I don't know if that optimization is still worth it.\r\n3. The basic idea is to ask the user which invoice to display. You could still refine this and alter behaviour in case the split you clicked on for this action has an associated invoice itself. This is more or less what you have implemented now. I'm in two minds whether this specialization is really beneficial or rather confusing. It's much easier to educate users on the concept of the three rules above than having to explain why sometimes you can't select the invoice to jump to for multi-invoice payments and sometimes you can.\r\n\r\nAnyway, much of the code will revolve around counting invoices in a transaction and determining the behaviour based on whether the number of invoices is 0, 1 or > 1.","submittedAt":"2020-07-02T08:12:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-03T03:35:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-04T19:27:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-04T19:52:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-04T20:30:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-05T11:01:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-05T14:30:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-05T14:33:38Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-05T14:45:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-08-15T05:52:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I personally can see no problem with the wording as I do use English but if there is better wording then by all means update them.","submittedAt":"2020-06-22T09:09:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-06-17T04:10:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It took a bit of studying to figure out the QofFakeQuery life cycle.

But notice that I believe aqbanking does exactly the same thing (pop the reconcile dialog before the transaction matching is done). I do agree that that does not make a lot of sense.\r\nBob, since you're looking at this, I suspect a difficulty: The match dialog call returns immediately (it's non-modal) so how do you suggest I pop the reconcile dialog *after* the matching is done? \r\nThe only solution I can see is to add the reconcile info (account, balance, date) to the matching dialog call (as a parameter, probably a structure, or a list of structures since we can have several accounts to reconcile) indicating \"open the reconcile when you're done\".

looks good to me.\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing I couldn't help thinking it would be good user experience if the OFX importer was transformed into an assistant as the csv importer. The current importer does everything in separate windows that close and open. The steps are similar:\r\n1. select a file or multiple files to import\r\n2. (csv needs a preview step, but can be skipped for ofx)\r\n3. account name matching step\r\n4. transaction matching step\r\n5. summary\r\n\r\nYour use case of processing multiple files in sequence can also be handled more elegantly with an assistant: for each file you do step 3 and 4. At the end of each step 4 you test whether there's still another file waiting. If so, jump back to step 3 with the new file. Or you could parse all files for unknown accounts in one go, offer step 3 only once and then repeat step 4 for each ofx file (even more elegant IMO, but perhaps not easy with libofx). Just a suggestion for future improvement.","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T08:44:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"DISMISSED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T08:46:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T16:27:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T16:28:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jeanlaroche"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T16:28:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T17:06:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T17:09:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-14T17:10:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Ok so if reconcile happens after each import, my concern doesn't make sense.

think there is a small problem here in that you're not actually specifying the date that the balance is computed.  Specifically, the balance will be computed at the end of time, which might not be the \"right\" balance.  This is a problem in multiple ways:\r\n1) If there are multiple SXes that fire, are you sure they are being inserted in order?  For example, let's say that the user went away for 3 months so has 3 mortgage payments fire simultaneously.  The first one might have the correct balance, but the next two probably wont.\r\n2) If you're dealing with an asset account that has multiple transactions going, the way the balance is computed probably wont be correct, either.\r\n\r\nIn my mind the correct function to use is xaccAccountGetBalanceAsOfDate(), but then you need to ensure you plug in the correct date.

you are working on this. The current state handling is a bit frustrating at times.\r\n\r\nYou bring up a good point with the default state for invoices and bills and I like to go a bit deeper into that.\r\n\r\nWith your additions we now save state for account registers, invoice windows and budgets.\r\n\r\nLet's start with invoices and bills. There are 3 layouts really, invoice layout, bill layout and voucher layout. We also support credit notes but these just use the same respective layouts per type. Each of these layouts has a fixed number of columns which can't be changed.\r\nOf all the fields, only the Description field can vary widely in content width. The others a few characters at most. I will assume that if a user changes any column other than the description column, chances are high this is because the current defaults aren't good - a date, amount, total,... doesn't fit due to particular font or style settings. On the other hand if the user changes the Description that may be because it doesn't fit too well for a particular document. I believe the former is much more likely than the latter.\r\n\r\nWhere I'm going with this is should we consider only allowing the user to save an updated default state rather than individual document states ?\r\nHere is what I would propose for invoices, bills, etc:\r\n* Add a menu item to set default state (you did). If the user clicks that, the state of the current document will be stored as default state and reused for all documents of the same type that will be opened subsequently. This will help in cases where a field is systematically too narrow or too wide.\r\n* For the description use case (where it's too wide or narrow on a particular document) I would propose to save state of open documents separately. We already do so. There's a page group for each open document. In there we add the current column widths. That means the state will be lost when the user closes the document, but at the same time it will be saved across gnucash restarts. This is a different trade-off to guard against an exploding state file than yours (which was to drop state for paid documents). I think saving individual state on not currently opened invoices only for a description field that may or may not be too wide is a bit overkill. I'll go even further in that if it's too long to fit completely, in most cases the part that is visible will already hold enough information to understand what the entry was about. So showing the complete field is rarely needed.\r\n* Have a menu item to reset the default state to built-in state.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm actually inclined to apply the same reasoning to the account registers. The most common motivation to change field widths is a field that's systematically too narrow. So implementing defaults for registers would make a lot of sense. We should keep in mind though there are several register types with a varying number of columns. Of the top of my head there are at least\r\n- the most basic register (denominated in a currency)\r\n- a commodity register (which will has amount, price and share price fields)\r\n- a business register (which will have a type field)\r\n- a general ledger (though that may just be a variation of the ordinary register with detailed split view)\r\n- ...\r\n So we'd need to save different defaults per register type. Other than that it can follow the same concept.\r\n\r\nFWIW I used to compare gnucash with a spreadsheet when thinking of how to handle columns. There is a difference though: spreadsheets are completely free-form grids of cells. What information goes into which column can vary arbitrarily from page (tab) to page (tab). That doesn't apply to gnucash. The columns are strictly defined and the information presented in pages of the same type is very similar. In addition a spreadsheet typically only has a handful of tabs (or sheets) at most. However gnucash keeps track of hundreds of objects that can all be represented in a tab. So where in a spreadsheet it would make sense to store column information for each sheet (tab), it does much less so for gnucash IMO.

I have pointed out a few cases in your code that effectively result in strings that can't be translated in all languages. Personally I don't think there's a universal solution to this using parameterized strings. While that would have allowed us to reuse a few shorter string translations we will always end up with grammatical issues in other languages. So we probably need to use full strings after all. That means more translation work, but at least they will be translatable in all cases.

Our policy so far has been that any data format change in a major release should be accompanied with changes in the most recent stable release in a way that that most recent stable release can at least still read the new format. It may not be able to write the new format, but it should be capable of reading the new format and writing the old format. With this \"one time budget sign fix\" we're in a bit of an awkward situation as it affects both data and reports together.\r\n\r\nAssuming 3.8 is the most recent stable version that should be able to read the new budget data format, that would mean that version should be able to read both the old and the new format:\r\n* users may be using 3.7 on other PC's and 3.8 should work well with that data.\r\n* or users may be using 4.0 on another PC and 3.8 should be able to interpret 4.x's data correctly.\r\n\r\nSo 3.8 needs a way to determine which data format it's looking at and act accordingly. We can use your newly added feature check `GNC_FEATURE_BUDGET_UNREVERSED` to make this distinction. But contrary to what you did that means 3.8 should be made aware of this flag so it should already be defined in 3.8. The clever trick lies in the fact the 3.x series will *never* actively set that flag. Only 4.x will. That will ensure that once 4.x converts the data, gnucash versions older than 3.7 will refuse to work on that data. 3.8 and up on the other hand will, and can use the presence of the flag to determine how to interpret the budget data.\r\n\r\nIf the flag is unset, treat the data as old style (with fragile sign reversals) and handle it accordingly in reports. If the flag is set, handle the data as new style (with canonical data stored) and handle sign reversals only while displaying.\r\n\r\nIt gets a bit more complicated when users manipulate budget data in 3.8 after it had been converted to new style. Conceptually the budget data is supposed to be written back in the old format (3.8 should only be able to read the new format, remember?). We could do that in theory, provided the feature flag is reset when that happens. In practice though I think this will be fairly complex. When exactly do you change from one format to the other ? The moment the user enters a new value in the budget ? When the data is saved again ? In all situations it will be tricky to make all parts of the code switch at the same time from one format to the other. I think it to more elegant to decide the format at load time and stick to it (either after an initial conversion as 4.x does or just using it as is in 3.x).\r\nThe side effect of that choice would be that 3.8 should be capable of both reading and writing old and new formats *and* the reports should be able to display either format.\r\n\r\nAiming for backwards compatibility is a bitch unfortunately...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second bit is user experience:\r\n\r\nThe backwards compatibility is one important aspect of this already of course.\r\n\r\nHere are just a few other smaller considerations:\r\n\r\nYou have already determined two use cases in which the conversion should not be run:\r\n- If it's already set\r\n- If the book doesn't contain any budgets\r\nThere's a third case: when the user isn't reverting accounts at all. In the case we can assume all amounts are already stored properly. Rather than running over each account with the function gnc_reverse_balance to find one, you can simply check whether the user's preference is set to a value that reverses certain accounts. That's roughly the same check gnc_reverse_balance does as well, only more direct.\r\n\r\nNext, the message provided to the user should be more elaborate. I think it should at least inform the user the old style data format was fragile wrt the account reversals necessitating a one-time fix. And it should make it clear that after applying the fix the data can't be opened anymore with versions of gnucash older the 3.8 (or whatever the first version will be that will be able to handle the new format).\r\n\r\nAnd then there are more subtle issues:\r\n- assume a user opens a pre-existing book that doesn't have any budgets yet in 4.x. Your current check will detect this and just skip any conversion attempt (and hence won't set the feature flag). The user now adds a budget (still in 4.x) and saves the book. Next restart gnucash. It will arrive again at this conversion check. The flag is not set, and at least one budget is present, so the conversion function is triggered. This is not what you want! The book was saved with gnucash 4.x so the budget values were already in the correct format and will now be inverted! To fix: the feature flag should also be set on save when the book contains at least one budget.\r\n- a variation based one the third option: there are no reversed account because the user preference dictated this. Assuming this third test is added, opening this book in 4.x will skip conversion. At some point the user decides s/he prefers to use an account reversal strategy after all and changes the preference. Upon first opening the book again in 4.x the conversion will run as the flag was not set. You could argue this wouldn't happen if we just run the conversion at all times, regardless of the user's chosen account reversal strategy. That's right, however that would also mean that in many cases we prevent users from using an older version of gnucash that could before even though the data hasn't changed. So instead I would set or reset the feature flag whenever the user changes the account reversal strategy. If there are no account reversals reset the flag, otherwise set it.\r\n\r\nNote the check for sign reverted accounts as third check assumes the user could have been sensibly using budgets with that user preference set in 3.x. I'm not sure that was actually the case as I haven't tested this. The above concept may need a few slight tweaks depending on the current state of budget issues in the 3.x series.","submittedAt":"2019-10-17T19:58:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-10-18T16:36:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"christopherlam"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-10-18T23:54:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jralls"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-10-19T00:06:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"See

I agree there are situations in which it's useful to know these version details in the python bindings, I also think it would be good to define the api directly in the gnucash C(++) code and expose that api instead.\r\n\r\nThis is most obvious for GNUCASH_BUILD_ID. That constant is currently used in two locations in the sources. In both cases it's used as is if it is not empty or replaced by the same default if it is empty. This risks getting out of sync if one wants to update the defautl, but forgets to change it in both locations. In principle the bindings are supposed to use the string in the same way again, which increases this risk of inconsistent use as each location has to do \"the same thing\".\r\n\r\nI have quickly looked over the code and I propose to incorporate this in what is now gnc-version.h. That is currently an auto-generated file. However I think it could be added as a fixed header file (with associated *.c file) in which we expose the functions as you have added in the gnucash_core.i file. Most functions can be exactly what you have created here. Only gnc_build_id should do the conditional stuff to return a common default if the constant is empty.","submittedAt":"2019-02-21T11:13:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"loftx"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-02-21T13:27:38Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-02-21T16:05:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"fellen"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-02-17T03:14:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"sicelo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-02-17T06:14:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the work Bob, and sorry for not reviewing earlier.

See some comments inline.\r\n\r\nAs to your questions:\r\n- if 35 handlers are left in the hash table that means indeed some gui objects are not properly cleaning up after themselves. So yes, please track those down and add the proper disconnect functions in the object destructors.\r\n- and the hash table should in theory be explicitly destroyed. However considering it's static, there will only ever be one and hence the memory leak would be minimal. It would have to happen on destruction of the GSettings backend, or on gnc_gsettings_unload_backend. But we don't have such a function (yet) so I can live with this minimal memory leak. The fact 35 signal handlers remain registered is a much more important leak which may lead to increased memory usage if gnucash is kept open for long times. So focus on that part first.

That is to say I don't think basing a strategy on row number is a good strategy.\r\n\r\nWhile you're in this area, can you improve the function to use report guids to manage the list of available reports instead of the detour via position in the list ?\r\n\r\nI think that would reduce the number of round trips to scheme code making the code more readable *and* faster.\r\n\r\nRegardless of guids vs row numbers (which I'll detail below), there's also no need to track selected lines. This information is readily available from the treeviews, at least until the tree models are cleared. So the functions related to tracking the selection can be removed and I suspect your first_run boolean can be replaced with whether you managed to extract a valid selection from the treeview (in row counting terms, set row to -1 to start, try to get the row number stored in the tree selection and check if this is still a valid number, if not set it to -1, then your selection loop should only run if selection is > -1. A similar strategy can be set up when using guids).\r\n\r\nThe guid story is that you store report guids (probably still most efficiently in SCM format) instead of row numbers in the tree store. With the changes as above you can start by extracting a guid from the existing tree selection. If there isn't one , set selection to SCM_UNDEFINED.\r\n\r\nThen you rebuild the list store. For each line you add you can check that line's guid against your selection one. If it matches that's the line to select at some point (either directly or in a followup loop, see inline comment on this idea).\r\n\r\nI think this slightly reduces the number or scm callouts.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would also be done for the content liststore, but that may be a bit more tricky as it involves changing the options internals to return a list of guids instead of a list of line numbers (although perhaps there is a function that would do so.

Ideally I would like to see this highlighting rect to be as high as the full transaction/line height, minus one px of yellow above and below.\r\n- when running gnucash I see warnings like this on the debug output: ```Gtk-WARNING **: Theme parsing error: gnucash.css:44:25: The :insensitive pseudo-class is deprecated. Use :disabled instead.```\r\n- the transfer account pop-up list will not close by clicking outside of it. It will only close by switching cells by keyboard navigation or by clicking the pop-down arrow again.\r\n\r\nSome of the changes I suggested can be done in a follow up branch. I would like to get most of what is here merged in before 2.7 is released as it's a big improvement already.

We hope to release 2.7 in the coming weekend provided we get the webkit issues solved on OS X and Windows.","submittedAt":"2017-09-27T21:19:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T13:54:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T13:55:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T13:57:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T13:58:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:01:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:05:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:08:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:09:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:25:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Bob-IT"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:27:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:28:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T14:43:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-28T17:59:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"marco-zietzling"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-04T06:56:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"quazgar"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-09-04T14:49:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"fellen"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It would be nice, if you could explain what happend there.\r\nOTOH I I just compared it with a fresh msgmerge and the result is the same for this PR.\r\n\r\nSo thank you for your hard work!","submittedAt":"2017-09-10T19:25:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"If everything in this file is indeed autogenerated due to running make pot I would indeed capture it in a separate commit.

Implement everything in **C++11** using a class hierarchy to provide calendar classes. Renam GncDateTimeImpl to GncGregorian create a new GncJalali subclass of GncDateTime. Provide a factory function that picks which one to instantiate based on the preference setting. gnc-jalali.h/c should be changed to gnc-jalali.hpp/cpp and should implement the GncJalali calendar class, using whatever of Christian’s old code that  you like, but translated into C++.\r\n\r\n The whole thing should be completely invisible to the C functions in gnc-date.cpp; gdate-utils will have to be converted to C++ (it can move to libqof too) so that it can call GncDateTime to do what it needs, and that will fix the problem of OS-provided date functions. We can't use them because 32-bit and LLP64 systems have a 32-bit time_t that fails for dates after mid-2038. gnc-date's time64 exists purely to work around that, but in GncJalali you can use boost::datetime directly.\r\n\r\nThen there's GncCalendar. Rather than copying the whole thing into GnuCash, you should subclass GtkCalendar and override only the functions that you need to.\r\n\r\nAside from the design problem, some general issues:\r\n\r\nPlease reformat your code to meet our [coding standards](http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/CodingStandard). You may find [artistic style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) helpful; we use ```astyle --indent=spaces=4 --brackets=break --suffix=none``` that cleans up most of the problems.\r\n\r\nBlock comments should be enclosed with ```/* … */```; ```/**…*/``` for Doxygen comments.\r\n\r\nYou declare ```static``` functions in header files. That’s a major no-no. ```static``` functions have scope only in the file they’re defined in.","submittedAt":"2017-02-04T23:35:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-02-05T18:17:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"gjanssens"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Started with the first commit of your PR.
