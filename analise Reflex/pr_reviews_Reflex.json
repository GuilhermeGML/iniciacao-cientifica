In most of my apps that use dynamic route vars, i typically have to add them to my state manually anyway, otherwise they cannot be referenced in some situations (like setting the page title for `app.add_page`).\r\n\r\nI wonder if it makes sense to dynamically add route vars to a specific substate, rather than the root state 🤔 Something like `rx.Query.redirect_me`. I know we have `rx.State.router.page.params[\"redirect_me\"]`, but that's kind of a lot to type. Although i guess if we're going to do that, then we should just have `rx.Query` implement `__getattr__` to return the full thing, then it would always be defined, even before the compile runs.\r\n\r\nThe other big problem I see in `state.py` is that substates cannot redefine or override fields from a parent state. Maybe this restriction doesn't make sense anymore... if a substate redefines a field, then it should be a _different_ value than the same-named field in a parent state, but that's just not how the code is written today.","submittedAt":"2024-08-20T23:52:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"masenf"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Instead of adding a field to ImmutableComputedVar, can we subclass it as `DynamicRouteVar` and use that as the determinant?","submittedAt":"2024-09-10T21:19:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"masenf"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-11T16:42:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"benedikt-bartscher"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-11T16:45:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"benedikt-bartscher"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-11T16:50:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"picklelo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-26T22:29:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"picklelo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"awesome!","submittedAt":"2024-08-19T20:41:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"masenf"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-20T17:25:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"picklelo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-15T16:29:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"masenf"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"maybe a comment for future maintainers?","submittedAt":"2024-08-13T20:40:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Lendemor"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-13T20:48:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"masenf"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-13T20:49:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"picklelo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-12T21:04:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"picklelo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-12T00:42:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"picklelo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for the delay here.

Your implementation seems to wrap an icon component in a button component, while this may work it doesnt give the desired outcome aesthetically.  The goal is to use the provided `iconButton` component chakra gives. If you look in the rendered js output (`.web/pages/index.js`), your implementation renders as :\r\n```js\r\n<button ariaLabel=\"send email\" icon=\"email\">\r\n  <EmailIcon/>\r\n```\r\nas opposed to :\r\n```js\r\n<IconButton\r\n  colorScheme='blue'\r\n  aria-label='Search database'\r\n  icon={<SearchIcon />}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\nYou'd also realize that the icon prop takes in a component(could be an icon component).

certain variables will be set external (and other tests apparently do set them, but we cannot rely on this always being the case).\r\n\r\nI also wrote an additional test case that sets values on the
