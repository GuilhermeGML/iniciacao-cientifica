"chriskrycho","CONTRIBUTOR","I think separating this out is good, but the package naming is wrong. (I wasn't following fully when we discussed it in Discord, sorry.) The problem is that it moves us *away* from npm-ready package names, because `@ember/debug/-basic` is *not* a legal package name. Instead, we probably want something like `@ember/-debug-basic` or `@ember/-basic-debug`, which per your comment to me is probably a good foundation for `@ember/debug` itself at some point. In the very near term, that's the part we care about most for being able to actually roll up our types without doing the shenanigans we are in #20316.

(For lookers-on, what Peter and I had discussed is: We can deprecate any other bits, move out the parts which are built on top of both `debug` and `-internals` into their own package, and then remove the `-debug-basic` once it's no longer needed.)","2022-12-09T00:02:13Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"chriskrycho","CONTRIBUTOR","The utility of this is obvious, of course, so *if* we keep the registry I think we should do it. My hesitation is that we need to make two decisions here before stabilization:

- whether to support the string-based registries *at all*
- what, if any, changes to make to them given the opportunity we have to make some long-needed breaking changes (e.g., should they refer to the class instead of the instance type?)

Notably, at this point the *only* place where the registries are useful constructs is in `lookup`. Accordingly, I’d like to discuss with @dfreeman and @jamescdavis before we merge (and @dfreeman is on vacation this week).","2022-09-12T13:07:33Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"chriskrycho","CONTRIBUTOR","Thanks again for working on this! We talked about it today at the Framework Core Team meeting, and noted that there were a couple gaps between the RFC which introduced `unique-id` and the actual implementation:

- the introduction of plain old functions as helpers via [RFC #0756: Default Helper Manager](https://rfcs.emberjs.com/id/0756-helper-default-manager)
- the lack of an import in support of template strict mode and first-class component templates
- the lack of a clear definition of 

These are *not* your responsibility to address as part of this change, however, so we’ve come up with a path that provides the public import we need for `<template>` support, as outlined in the rest of this review.

If you’re interested, we need to do some work separately to solve those issues, by writing a small RFC which defines how we should approach helpers like this going forward, not least so they *can* be usable as normal JS functions without the extra bits you'll see below. Let me know if you’re interested in that: @wycats is available to help get that written!

Again, though, the only things we need to do to land *this* are to address the comments in the review. Thanks for doing this!","2022-09-02T20:14:46Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"chancancode","MEMBER","Broadly 👍🏼 from me.

I think we can quibble on whether the examples copied from the RFCs are actually useful for explaining what the feature is. In the RFC they are more geared towards exhausting most of the possibilities, in a spec-by-examples kind of way. In documentation that may be a bit much and the point kind of gets lost. In other words, we may want to trim it down so that we only have one or two succinct/common use cases that gets the main point across.

That being said, any docs are certainly better than no docs. So if @SergeAstapov wants to do another pass now I think that's great, but otherwise we can also just merge it and let someone else iterate on this another time.

"chriskrycho","CONTRIBUTOR","I noted a bunch of places where our `@module` declarations in the docs seem to have been simply wrong, and AFAICT this is one part of why the actual generated module docs are substantially less useful than might have been hoped. Between your reorganization and adding those in, I think it might make a nice win for the docs while we're still on YUIDoc (though a colleague is working on doing the work to transition us to TSDoc-powered docs, almost certainly via TypeDoc). That said… it’s possible these are *intentionally* only showing the top-level module, which while deeply unhelpful may be important for some other reason at the moment?

cc. @jenweber @locks: do we *want* to have only (for example) `@ember/routing` rather than `@ember/routing/route` for the `@module` declarations?

---

A related thought: we should consider whether we might want to introduce a `public`/`private` directory, so that you end up with this for input/output structure:

```
.
├── dist
│   ├── -private
│   │   ├── internal-only.d.ts
│   │   └── internal-only.js
│   └── public
│       ├── index.d.ts
│       ├── index.js
│       ├── other.d.ts
│       └── other.js
└── src
    ├── -private
    │   └── internal-only.ts
    └── public
        ├── index.ts
        └── other.ts
```

Once [this Typedoc issue](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/1937) is resolved, we can theoretically start leveraging package `exports` maps to make it so consumers *cannot* use the `-private` directories (if we so desire), with a very straightforward per-package config:

```json
{
  ""exports"": {
    ""."": ""./dist/public/index.js"",
    ""./package.json"": ""./package.json"",
    ""./*"": ""./dist/public/*.js""
  }
}

"mixonic","MEMBER","@btecu I think in the testing suite in general (both in places I flagged and even in places I didn't flag) the right path here is to refactor the assertions to use the router service public API instead of the application controller API. Removing the assertions (or tests) entirely is too much of a change, and degrades out test coverage of how Ember reflect routing state.

Can you give it another look through that lens?","2021-08-22T00:08:45Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"pzuraq","CONTRIBUTOR","So I believe that `_lazyInjections` can also be removed as part of this work. As far as I can tell, it's basically creating and setting up lazy versions of implicit injections, only in DEBUG, and I can't see any usage in the ecosystem at all: https://emberobserver.com/code-search?codeQuery=_lazyInjections

It's explicitly marked as a private API as well, so should be fine to remove. Overall this PR looks amazing and once those changes are made, I think we're good to merge!","2021-08-17T15:37:56Z",false,"APPROVED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","Sorry this has been such a hassle @patocallaghan. I think we need to tweak the implementation a bit though. A large number of these tests don't seem to be using a custom `renderTemplate`, and they shouldn't be issuing a deprecation (if they do, that would mean that applications _basically_ have no way to avoid the deprecation).

Basically, we need make it so that we avoid deprecation if you don't implement your own `renderTemplate`.","2021-02-28T01:07:12Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","Looking really good! I left a few inline comments/questions, but I think we are also missing some test cases:

* Usage of `invokeHelper` with custom helper managers (will need to be guarded by both feature flags, but should still be tested)
* Ensuring that associating destructors to the the helper context works properly (for both `Ember.Helper`/`Ember.Helper.helper` helpers and custom helpers)
* Usage of non-class based helpers
* Confirming the caching of the `computeArgs`, specifically how many times the third argument is expected to be invoked in various contexts
* Confirming that a helper that accesses none of the args (positional or named), and nothing else is ""constant""
* Confirming that a helper that accesses only args that themselves are constant (e.g. the `computeArgs` function is something that uses no tags), is constant

"rwjblue","MEMBER","Changes generally look good to me, only a few remaining concerns from my perspective:

* What enumerable properties remain on an object _if_ it operates with the right protocol? Specifically, does `Object.keys(EmberObject.create())` return anything, is it platform dependent? I think we need to bring back tests for this, it has been important in the past. IMHO, if we end up increasing the number of own properties this probably can't land in `release` (e.g. it would at least need to flow through the beta cycle).
* Should we consider adding a version of `setOwner` that does not set `LEGACY_OWNER` (either another export, or a third argument)? I'd much prefer to never export `OWNER` and force _all_ users (internal and external) through the same protocol...
* I haven't looked at what is up with the tests.","2020-08-09T15:45:58Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","This doesn't seem like a regression to me 🤔. I definitely see what you mean (it does seem odd to call `didReceiveAttrs` again), but the public API for `didReceiveAttrs` has always been that we guarantee that it will be called when anything changes but **not** exactly the number of times called (this is roughly the same thing as with observers).

Can you add the same test with an object, I think we should generally match the behavior of that here. 

<details>
<summary>Thinking something like this.</summary>

```js
    ['@test mutating an array from within component should not trigger `didReceiveAttrs`'](assert) {
      let didReceiveAttrsCount = 0;

      this.registerComponent('non-block', {
        ComponentClass: Component.extend({
          didReceiveAttrs() {
            this._super(...arguments);
            didReceiveAttrsCount++;
          },

          actions: {
            click() {
              this.model = this.set('model.foo', 'baz');
            },
          },
        }),
        template: `
          <button {{action ""click""}}>Click Me!</button>
          <br>
          {{@model.foo}}
        `,
      });

      this.render('{{non-block model=model}}', {
        model: { foo: ""bar"" },
      });

      runTask(() => this.$('button').click());

      assert.equal(didReceiveAttrsCount, 1, '`didReceiveAttrs` only called once');
    }
```

"pzuraq","CONTRIBUTOR","It looks like there's a test failing that explicitly tests the `undefined` behavior. I'm not sure it's ever actually used, though, and like you pointed out we could do a different optimization if it is.

I'd personally be ok with this optimization, though I think that ideally we would perform a benchmark to see what the difference is. We've been working on getting benchmarks like setup and automated, but we're not quite there yet.","2020-03-13T15:28:24Z",false,"COMMENTED"
"rwjblue","MEMBER","In general, this seems like a good change to make. We just need to make sure that `undefined` as a value is still cacheable (probably by using a sentinel value and comparing it directly, but we'd need to test to see if that kills the test improvement).","2020-05-23T20:58:31Z",false,"COMMENTED"

This can be somewhat mitigated by only adding the `try`/`catch` when `completedWithoutError` is `false` in the Environment.prototype.commit.","2019-09-18T19:31:11Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

BRW, I totally agree with you that this should ultimately be significantly refactored.

"rwjblue","MEMBER","Generally :+1:, but I think we need to do two more small tweaks to ensure this change doesn't troll us:

* Ensure that using the global `Promise` triggers an eslint failure
* Ensure that using `async` / `await` in non-test code triggers an eslint failure (I've used https://github.com/brendenpalmer/eslint-plugin-disable-features for this in the past)","2019-04-24T13:41:47Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","Looking good! I left some minor inline comments for tweaks, but we also need to flag this for svelting.

The rough steps for svelting are:

* Add a new export from `packages/@ember/deprecated-features/index.js`, the string value should be `3.11.0-beta.1` (which will be the first tagged release including the deprecation)
* Import that boolean flag and surround any code supporting `isVisible` with a conditional (e.g. `if (EMBER_COMPONENT_IS_VISIBLE) { /* code here */ }`)

Some example PRs adding svelting as part of a deprecation:

* https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17910
* https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17540
* https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/16685

The goal here is that any code that is supporting a deprecated feature will (eventually) be able to be stripped from apps that declare that they are ""deprecation free"" for a given version.","2019-04-19T13:42:28Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","Looking really good! Could you also add examples using angle bracket invocation?

```hbs
<MyComponent /> {{! without block }}
<MyComponent></MyComponent> {{! with block }}
```

Also, `has-block` accepts a single argument: the name of the block. The name (at the moment) is either ""main"" or ""inverse"" (though only curly components support inverse). I think that argument needs to be added to the docs for both `has-block` and `has-block-params`.","2019-03-18T19:00:36Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"chriskrycho","CONTRIBUTOR","This is 💯! There's one bit of the implementation that should be lightly tweaked from the TS perspective, and I've left a comment to that effect.

Two questions this raises for me (that are born of my ignorance, with no implied commentary on the PR):

1. What if anything are the performance implications of doing array tracking with this?
2. Assuming those performance implications are relatively minimal… can we implement this same behavior for POJOs, given how they're often used as dictionaries? If not, what's the difference?","2019-03-18T03:26:51Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","Thank you for putting together a failing test for this! It makes understanding what is being reported much easier. 

Unfortunately, I don’t think this is actually a bug 😭. The invocation rules for mustaches are such that only the _first_ position will automatically invoke a helper, but subsequent path expressions (that are not surrounded in paren) are referring to paths on the template context. 

The best medicine here is to avoid the ambiguous case completely (generally by enabling the template lint rule that forbids it). That would change your invocation to `<FooBar @foo={{this.baz}} />` (and `this.baz` would be used in both curly and angle invocations).","2018-09-20T12:35:16Z",false,"COMMENTED"

Can you also ensure we call `page.close()` when we are done with a given test run? I think that we would need to add some `page.waitForFunction` ([docs here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagewaitforfunctionpagefunction-options-args)) or something after the `page.goto`, then once QUnit.done fires we can call `page.close()`.

I left some inline comments (mostly just moving from `assert.throws` to `expectAssertion` which should fix an issue with the production build), but would also like to see some tests added confirming a few additional scenarios work:

* `{{some-thing foo=(if)}}` should error
* `{{some-thing foo=(if foo bar baz)}}` should not error
* `{{if foo bar baz}}` should not error

"mixonic","MEMBER","@cibernox Thank you for your continued work on this. Improving the test suite unblocks feature work like async rendering and cleanup like removing the default globals resolver.

The big change I'm going to ask for is to refactor use of `handleUrl` and the helper methods in to `visit` based calls. AFAICT, none of these tests are `handleURL` specific. Instead, they used that API because the predated our public-facing `visit` API for navigating an Ember app.

Additionally some of the tests ported in this PR do:

```js
return this.visit('/').then(() => {
  run(() => this.handlUrl(assert, somePath);
  // more assertions
});
```

In these cases the ""visit then handle"" is probably not needed. If the test is not specifically asserting the behavior of a transition (from / to the handled route) these tests can just become:

```js
return this.visit(somePath).then(() => {
  // more assertions
});
```

Again the old tests were likely booting then handling a URL not because they wanted a transition, but because they could not boot the application with an initial path besides `/`.","2018-03-04T17:10:09Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"krisselden","CONTRIBUTOR","Overall I would like to drop the isPath cache if it isn't buying us much but one thing I'm remembering is originally we had it like this, but it was faster to check if the key was a miss before checking isPath.  I'm for trying this again, but wondering if it would be better to add an isPath arg to get to override whether the indexOf check is done again.  Also wonder if caching splits would be better than caching isPath. Also if the isPath cache limit was too low.

It would be good to gather get() calls from some apps and make a microbenchmark for this.  The microbenchmark could still add some pollution at the start.","2018-05-01T18:55:21Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","To add a test I think we would need to have a test module that extends from rendering test (but not application test).

Something like what you linked, but slightly different:

```js
import { moduleFor, RenderingTest } from '../../utils/test-case';

moduleFor('Link-to component', class extends RenderingTest {
  ['@test should be able to be inserted in DOM when the router is not present - block']() {
    this.addTemplate('application', `{{#link-to 'index'}}Go to Index{{/link-to}}`);

    this.render(`{{#link-to 'index'}}Go to Index{{/link-to}}`);
    this.assertText('Go to Index');
  }

  ['@test should be able to be inserted in DOM when the router is not present - inline']() {
    this.addTemplate('application', `{{#link-to 'index'}}Go to Index{{/link-to}}`);

    this.render(`{{link-to 'Go to Index' 'index'}}`);
    this.assertText('Go to Index');
  }
});
```

You can add ^ to the same file, just below the current `moduleFor`...","2017-11-30T23:23:45Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"rwjblue","MEMBER","As it stands, this leaks `ApplicationInstance` instances in things like fastboot and non `packages/ember-testing` related tests. In those circumstances many `ApplicationInstance` instances are created and ""thrown away"" to be garbage collected.

I think an alternative way to solve the same general problem would be to have the `ApplicationInstance` push itself into the `Application`'s `_applicationInstances ` array, then splice itself out of that array in the `ApplicationInstance#willDestroy`.  This setup would avoid leaking the `ApplicationInstance` when things are handled properly (e.g. in non-error conditions) and still provide the cleanup that is needed when things go haywire in a given test...","2017-11-03T21:52:51Z",false,"COMMENTED"
"rwjblue","MEMBER","The test cleanup here is looking really nice! Please keep it up!

Still have the same concerns as mentioned previously about leakage. As of https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/pull/237 (which is included in `ember-cli@2.17.0` out of the box) we create a single application instance and call `application.buildInstance()` once for each test in the application (and subsequently destroy them during normal test teardown). The array created to track all created `Ember.ApplicationInstance` instances **will** leak the entire contents of the container for each test (the same leak will occur in fastboot per request).

The simple fix (as mentioned above) is to have the `ApplicationInstance` instances splice their own entry out of the array (possibly by adding a `Ember.Application.prototype.destroyInstance` which would be the inverse of `Ember.Application.prototype.buildInstance`).","2017-11-18T00:13:51Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"locks","CONTRIBUTOR","For me, the ""noise"" introduced by this change far outweighs the potential benefit if you happen to be using `ember-suave`. Mind you, all the incidental blueprint-related documentation (Guides, API) would have to be updated to match.
I would like to also point out that the canary channel of Ember CLI–via [`ember-cli-shims`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-shims)– now contains an implementation of [RFC #176](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0176-javascript-module-api.md), with `@ember/component` style imports. Production-stopping bugs aside, it should follow the natural cycle of canary-beta-release and be available for everyone in one of the next releases.","2017-06-24T11:45:11Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"mixonic","MEMBER","Talked with @dgeb, and I think this psuedo code would be correct for us to ensure we get the higher precedence for local/private lookups over global when resolving a pair of things:

```
`
a:/my-app/widgets/x-mark
b:/my-app/widgets/top-level/x-mark
`

let source = 'b:/my-app/widgets/top-level';

* `assert` is passed as the first argument to tests, should be used for assertions instead of the globals.
* `this.runTask` is preferred over `run`
* `run` shouldn't be needed around `initializer` calls

* Calls to `jqueryObj.click()` don't need to be wrapped in a runloop.
* In general if there is a runloop, use `this.runTask(() => { /* somthing */ });` instead.
* `router.handleURL` is just a legacy way to write `this.visit`, and we should move toward the latter.

Generally there would be, but I believe the point here is that we don't think there is a replacement. This was only added and used by FastBoot, so I believe the answer mostly is: ""refactor to not need it"".

> Is the chosen id for the deprecation appropriate?

Yes, seems good. 

> Is this PR pointed at the right branch? The Contributing.md mentions some stuff but not sure where adding deprecations fits in

Yes, targeting master branch is perfect. 

---

Overall, I think this is pretty solid, and is likely good to land on master. 

@kratiahuja / @tomdale - Can y'all confirm that the FastBoot usage is removed?

I think we need test cases for the following scenarios:

* `router.urlFor('something', { selectedItems: ['a', 'b', 'c'] })` (a query param that is an array)
* `router.urlFor('something', { stuff: null })`
* `router.urlFor('something', { stuff: undefined })`
* `router.urlFor('something', { stuff: 'foo' })` where `something` route defines a custom `serializeQueryParam` method
* Tests defining a controller for the target, where the controller throws an error in `init`. The idea here is to ensure that we are not forcing controller instances to be created when generating the URL (which is a significant part of the performance issues surrounding `{{link-to}}`).","2017-03-03T14:34:51Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

- Make sure to add exports to the code samples
- No newline between code fence (triple backtick) and code
- Code fences should have newlines _around_ them to avoid rendering problems

A matter that I also want to raise is naming the component `profile-component`. While global-style should be the most minimal of use cases, I personally think it might be confusing to have a component with a `-component` suffix because in global-style that would make it `ProfileComponentComponent`. I also don't want to induce people into thinking components need to have that suffix. What do you think?","2017-01-02T13:08:34Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"mixonic","MEMBER","Thanks so much for getting this going @chadhietala. The big item is that `lookup` should still be using double extend. If you want to add a second feature flag (ideally in a followup) that experimentally switches `lookup` to the non-double-extended factory, that would definitely be welcome as a distinct feature flag.
