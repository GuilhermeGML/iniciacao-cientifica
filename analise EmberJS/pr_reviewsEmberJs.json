(I wasn't following fully when we discussed it in Discord, sorry.) The problem is that it moves us *away* from npm-ready package names, because `@ember/debug/-basic` is *not* a legal package name. Instead, we probably want something like `@ember/-debug-basic` or `@ember/-basic-debug`, which per your comment to me is probably a good foundation for `@ember/debug` itself at some point. In the very near term, that's the part we care about most for being able to actually roll up our types without doing the shenanigans we are in #20316.\r\n\r\n(For lookers-on, what Peter and I had discussed is: We can deprecate any other bits, move out the parts which are built on top of both `debug` and `-internals` into their own package, and then remove the `-debug-basic` once it's no longer needed.)","submittedAt":"2022-12-09T00:02:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"wagenet"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-01-04T17:14:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"wagenet"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-12-06T20:20:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"chriskrycho"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"⭐ ","submittedAt":"2022-12-06T20:21:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"chriskrycho"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems good.

We talked about it today at the Framework Core Team meeting, and noted that there were a couple gaps between the RFC which introduced `unique-id` and the actual implementation:\r\n\r\n- the introduction of plain old functions as helpers via [RFC #0756: Default Helper Manager](https://rfcs.emberjs.com/id/0756-helper-default-manager)\r\n- the lack of an import in support of template strict mode and first-class component templates\r\n- the lack of a clear definition of \r\n\r\nThese are *not* your responsibility to address as part of this change, however, so we’ve come up with a path that provides the public import we need for `<template>` support, as outlined in the rest of this review.\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested, we need to do some work separately to solve those issues, by writing a small RFC which defines how we should approach helpers like this going forward, not least so they *can* be usable as normal JS functions without the extra bits you'll see below. Let me know if you’re interested in that: @wycats is available to help get that written!\r\n\r\nAgain, though, the only things we need to do to land *this* are to address the comments in the review. Thanks for doing this!","submittedAt":"2022-09-02T20:14:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"TechieQian"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-09-02T21:27:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"TechieQian"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-09-02T23:28:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"bertdeblock"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good AFAICT!","submittedAt":"2023-02-11T10:58:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"rwjblue"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-26T16:11:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"chriskrycho"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-26T04:07:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"wagenet"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-26T15:45:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"chriskrycho"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-26T15:53:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"chriskrycho"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-26T23:14:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"wagenet"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-26T23:52:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"chriskrycho"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-27T01:58:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"rwjblue"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you!","submittedAt":"2022-08-20T23:23:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"NullVoxPopuli"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-04T23:24:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"NullVoxPopuli"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-04T23:25:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"NullVoxPopuli"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-04T23:26:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"SolPier"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-05T07:24:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"SolPier"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-06T07:56:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"geneukum"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-22T14:08:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"mixonic"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Wonderful, thank you @SolPier ","submittedAt":"2022-10-03T00:31:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"NullVoxPopuli"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-06T19:50:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jenweber"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you!

generally look good to me, only a few remaining concerns from my perspective:\r\n\r\n* What enumerable properties remain on an object _if_ it operates with the right protocol? Specifically, does `Object.keys(EmberObject.create())` return anything, is it platform dependent? I think we need to bring back tests for this, it has been important in the past. IMHO, if we end up increasing the number of own properties this probably can't land in `release` (e.g. it would at least need to flow through the beta cycle).\r\n* Should we consider adding a version of `setOwner` that does not set `LEGACY_OWNER` (either another export, or a third argument)? I'd much prefer to never export `OWNER` and force _all_ users (internal and external) through the same protocol...\r\n* I haven't looked at what is up with the

As of https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/pull/237 (which is included in `ember-cli@2.17.0` out of the box) we create a single application instance and call `application.buildInstance()` once for each test in the application (and subsequently destroy them during normal test teardown). The array created to track all created `Ember.ApplicationInstance` instances **will** leak the entire contents of the container for each test (the same leak will occur in fastboot per
