`./ios-docs/v-${version.toLowerCase().replace(\".\",\"-\"}`,\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: we already have a version config map so we could also reuse it to allow configuring the fs path? \r\n\r\nThere's a bit of confusion between version route path and fs path unfortunately ü§™ \r\n\r\n\r\nSee https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#ex-config\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    [\r\n      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs',\r\n      {\r\n        path: 'docs',\r\n        versions: {\r\n          current: {\r\n            path: 'ios-2.0.0',\r\n          },\r\n          '1.0.0': {\r\n            path: 'ios-1.0.0',\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should discuss the tradeoffs of various design options we have (probably in the other issue so others can participate) and agree on something

it.","submittedAt":"2023-03-09T18:18:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-03-08T18:12:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"tannerdolby"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-03-09T03:34:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Support

In that case, it should probably keep being highlighted if we browse it from the permalink URL or any of the aliases. The theme code probably doesn't account for this yet. There are also things to consider like navbar items highlighting, although people rarely link to blog post URLs from the navbar and can use the regexp active fn.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn alternative implementation that is likely faster than rendering twice the same blog post could be to just copy the static file in the build output, inside the `postBuild` hook?\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncp build/blog/folder/myBlogPost.html build/blog/another-folder/myBlogPostAlias.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nPro: much faster if there are many aliases (unlikely? ü§î )\r\nCons: worst DX, aliases not working in dev unless we implement something.

The HTTP port, the bundler, the watchers, the first compilation? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That's not clear to me. Can you reference docs of other bundlers having a similar concept?\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'd rather see you implement the Webpack proprietary solution first: this would allow me to inspect it to understand better what you are trying to do, and in particular what files/data you need to read and when.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, you want to use it to generate your search index. Don't you want to re-generate it as well on any markdown file edit? Wouldn't it be confusing for users to have a local search that \"almost works\" locally but not completely? Wouldn't it be better to use the same logic and timing for both dev/prod?\r\n\r\nAs I don't know the code you plan to implement, it's hard to understand if it's a good decision to add this new hook. And I'd rather not introduce officially a hook to figure out later that it's finally not the solution to your problem: a userland solution (or marking the API as experimental/secret) permits to avoid that.\r\n\r\nThere are things to consider, for example the fact that the bundler may start after the postStart hook (lazily on first request), or simply that we might turn on [`experiments.lazyCompilation`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/experiments/#experimentslazycompilation) in the future in which the app compilation will happen in multiple steps. It might not be a problem for your specific use-case, but can become confusing for other use-cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI read some code in https://github.com/gabrielcsapo/docusaurus-plugin-search-local/blob/main/src/server/utils/postBuildFactory.ts\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand you are reading emitted HTML files. Those files won't be emitted with the dev server. I'd really like to know what's your plan in this case. Seeing a working userland implementation prototype (even if coupled to Webpack) would help understand all this better.\r\n\r\nThinking from first principles, it doesn't seem to me parsing HTML files with cheerio is the right solution. We should expose local search plugins to some kind of data layer for them to create a similar index in dev/prod. Ideally the index should support hot reload and be fast, and well-integrated with the bundler caching system.\r\n\r\nFor this to happen we'll likely need to create our own Docusaurus local search plugin (which we want) otherwise it's hard to figure out the correct public API to expose without the ability to experiment.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","submittedAt":"2022-10-26T13:41:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-08T12:31:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks!","submittedAt":"2022-07-08T04:53:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thank you!","submittedAt":"2022-07-07T15:46:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"LAUGH","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Makes sense, thanks!","submittedAt":"2022-07-07T07:45:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-07T04:21:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-07T04:28:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks","submittedAt":"2022-07-07T07:58:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Could you add a test post, as the PR template requires?","submittedAt":"2022-07-06T05:05:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-06T02:01:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jqshuv"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-06T08:05:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-06T08:09:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jqshuv"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-07-06T08:29:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Josh-Cena"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Great, thanks!\r\n\r\nI don't use devcontainers myself so it's always maintained by community contributors.

`<Img>` component in Docusaurus and it's a common practice to add some IntersectionObserver logic to make it load eagerly images that are close to entering the viewport (similar to links/idealImage)\r\n\r\nNote users that want to disable lazy loading can still disable this thanks to a remark plugin. It's not very convenient/elegant but it's just erasing `loading=\"lazy\"` from the image jsx string.\r\n\r\nI think we can ship this by default and see if anyone complains, to eventually revert or provide an option.\r\n\r\nMy only concern: do we want lazy loading for images we couldn't compute width/height?

This PR can serve as a POC to see if an approach is right.\r\n\r\nThis kind of change can be disruptive for our users with custom themes, and we should avoid doing 2 chances in 2 distinct releases when we can do only one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe current approach is not good enough, the SVGs remain loaded through SVGR, converted to the same React components as before, and SVG markup is still duplicated in the final HTML\r\n\r\nI don't know what is the best solution to this problem yet, just some ideas:\r\n- Use `url('./icon.svg')` in CSS => this should use file-loader instead of SVGR due to usage in CSS\r\n- Force usage of inline file-loader in JS file and use with `<img>` tag?\r\n\r\nI asked a question here, some proposed approaches might be interesting to explore:

for the cleanup :) \r\n\r\nThere's something that bothers: you moved all the theme types to `@docusaurus/types` but this type package is meant to be used for core types, not plugin/theme types, as these types are specific to one theme in particular, but some users might want to use Docusaurus with a totally different theme  with different types. That's why {} is a valid/default type and the core ThemeConfig should remain `Record<string,any>` or something similar. Note it's possible  to use Docusaurus with multiple themes at the same time, and we end up with a composition where the final theme config is the theme config of the 2 underlying themes (`ClassicThemeConfig & LiveCodeBlockThemeConfig`)\r\n\r\nIn practice, the plan is to share a common ThemeConfig type across multiple themes (classic/bootstrap/tailwind), but keep the core agnostic of those types, that's why the types were put in `@docusaurus/theme-common` \r\n\r\nFor now, it's not necessary to take any care of the bootstrap theme, it is  not ready for usage at all.","submittedAt":"2021-03-15T18:29:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"HonkingGoose"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-14T19:24:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"steveworley"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-14T22:14:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-15T18:47:57Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-15T18:49:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"lex111"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-13T21:22:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"lex111"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-13T21:28:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"quanengineering"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-14T03:37:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"quanengineering"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-14T09:19:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lex111"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-15T14:02:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-15T18:04:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-15T18:06:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"polarathene"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-16T03:19:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"polarathene"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-16T03:22:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"polarathene"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-16T05:11:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"MatanBobi"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-16T08:16:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"MatanBobi"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-03-16T08:19:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"MatanBobi"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

Possibly, using `git cp` and `git mv` commands instead of fs.writeFile etc.\r\n\r\nI tried the following, and it didn't work great  :p \r\n\r\n`yarn docusaurus-migrate migrate website-1.x website-1.x`\r\n\r\nFor tests, you could just copy ./website-1.x to /tmp/random, and migrate the site here directly\r\n\r\nThis may be a lot of work, please give a try, and tell me if you think it's possible to do something about git history, or if it would be overkill \r\n\r\n## Steps and logs\r\n\r\nOne important thing to consider, is that we likely have errors in this migration cli. It's hard to plan for every weird thing the users would have on their v1 sites.\r\n\r\nThe current cli executes the migrations step by step. The major problem with this approach is that if the 1st step fails for any random reason, the user is blocked and unable to run the other steps in an automated way. \r\n\r\nI think it's worth considering the worst case scenario and enable the user to run each step independently. By default we could run all steps one by one, and if some step fails, maybe just log the error and continue to next step?\r\n\r\nIt's worth considering if order of steps matter.\r\n\r\nAlso, that would be nice to have logs of what is happening exactly. Maybe have a std status at the end of each step, like \"success/failed/skipped\" or something?\r\n\r\nThe current output is not very verbose about what's happening exactly.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86946634-f75c8d80-c14a-11ea-90a2-687c237ca547.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migrate the pages\r\n\r\nThat would be cool if we could automate this part a little bit.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to use JSCodeShift and codemods to transform automatically commonJS to ESM modules, or stateless classes to SFCs...\r\n\r\nI've built a tool to \"modernize\" a react file a few years ago, that was basically running jscodeshift + eslint --fix + prettier (not maintained, but could serve as inspiration): https://github.com/slorber/react-reboot/blob/980bf2fc05eb310f5bfc7d530cd48659b7dc098f/src/lib/react-reboot.js\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the component library, as there are only 3 comps, we could inline those comps directly in page:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst CompLibrary = require('../../core/CompLibrary.js');\r\n\r\nconst MarkdownBlock = CompLibrary.MarkdownBlock; /* Used to read markdown */\r\nconst Container = CompLibrary.Container;\r\nconst GridBlock = CompLibrary.GridBlock;\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould become:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// TODO migrate those v1 components\r\nconst MarkdownBlock = (props) => <div {...props}/>\r\nconst Container = (props) => <div {...props}/>\r\nconst GridBlock = (props) => <div {...props}/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, we could migrate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = Users;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default function UsersPage(props) {\r\n  return (\r\n     <Layout title=\"your page title\">\r\n       <Users {...props}/>\r\n     </Layout>\r\n   )\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, migrate `<translate>` to `<Translate>` and provide a no-op impl like for comp library\r\n\r\nThat's worth checking some existing sites to see their pages and if this can be automated without being too complicated (probably we don't want to do AST manipulations).\r\n\r\nSites like Prettier are doing annoying things like `const siteConfig = require(process.cwd() + \"/siteConfig.js\");`\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is really a best effort, if this fails, it's not a big deal, the user will have errors in his terminal, or in the browser anyway...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","submittedAt":"2020-07-08T17:42:56Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"anshulrgoyal"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-08T17:46:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"anshulrgoyal"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-21T17:29:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"anshulrgoyal"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-22T07:14:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"That looks great.

about it.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the site I think it's less important to preserve the history anyway.\r\n\r\nNote: I only talk about the docs folder, not the versioned docs, for which it's less

of all, I wanted to point out that this is a greatest improvement, I really like it, we will definitely include it in the upcoming Docusaurus release! But before that, we need to work on something to achieve an even better result.\r\n\r\n1. New search box in navbar _catches the eye_ -- it stands out from all other UI elements of navbar. We don't need to focus on this particular element that way.\r\n\r\n![screenshot_15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247234-e9126d80-a1ab-11ea-868d-eb71c11a3253.png)\r\n\r\nI would make the background not so dark, rather the background from the current implementation is more suitable. In addition, I think it is necessary to reduce its height by analogy the current search input.\r\n\r\n![screenshot_14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247247-ec0d5e00-a1ab-11ea-85d7-22a62f0c804e.png)\r\n \r\nBTW keyboard elements doesn‚Äôt look well on my Linux computer, eg, the text of ‚ÄúCTRL‚Äù is poorly read (see first screnshoot above).\r\n\r\nTherefore, other keyboard elements in SVG look much clearer than if they are stylized using CSS. Maybe it makes sense to switch to use SVG icons in the search box too?\r\n\r\n![screenshot_19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247204-de57d880-a1ab-11ea-8a20-ea04fb589384.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition, in the dark mode, I believe that we also need to adopt the background from the current search.\r\n\r\n| New   | Old    |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83250385-b3bc4e80-a1b0-11ea-824b-4252d173daf3.png) | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83250466-d51d3a80-a1b0-11ea-87c4-9cdfe59b898e.png) |\r\n\r\nThe shadow of the keyboard icons is pretty visible, maybe it reduce it?\r\n\r\n2. On small screens (eg iPhone 5), we see that the search navbar is positioned incorrectly. Earlier, in the previous release we did only display the search icon on mobiles, you can look at https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/2791 for more details.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83249167-d64d6800-a1ae-11ea-965a-404416afca45.png)\r\n\r\nIn this implementation search, I think we need to do the same. (Although in my opinion it looks worse than in the current version. Maybe the search in oval form looks better than a round one. Or the new magnifier icon is not very strong -- I'm not sure).\r\n\r\n| Issue on small mobiles   | Proposed solution    |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| ![screenshot_12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247273-f3346c00-a1ab-11ea-80dc-8ab87ee298c2.png) | ![screenshot_13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247264-efa0e500-a1ab-11ea-81f5-dd242177db89.png) |\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Instead of a hard-coded magenta color, is it better for us to use the [primary color website](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/master/website/src/css/custom.css#L9) to style a new search?\r\n\r\n| Current behavior   | Proposed solution based on a website styling (by example of Docusaurus)   |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| ![screenshot_18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247209-e0219c00-a1ab-11ea-9248-2e5c2d937b4e.png) | ![screenshot_17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247214-e1eb5f80-a1ab-11ea-9be8-1c56493ba88f.png) |\r\n\r\n4. Minor bugs:\r\n\r\n- The vertical scroll bar is displayed even if there is no scrollable content. Can we show it only when it is really needed?\r\n\r\n![screenshot_16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247221-e4e65000-a1ab-11ea-9f3d-dcae66e948ef.png)\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAlso see

@francoischalifour,\r\n\r\nI tested the feature and it seems to work fine.\r\nThanks for adding the / shortcut, that will be helpful, and both shortcuts seems common.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few things I'd like to get discussed or changed before merging this PR:\r\n\r\n## base Url\r\n\r\nSearch links do not work for sites with a baseURL\r\n\r\n## localstorage mandatory ?\r\n\r\n@krillboi has expressed the need to avoid using local storage: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/2815#issuecomment-641838973\r\n\r\nDo we have an option that permits this? What should we say to users that want no local storage usage?\r\n\r\n## theme\r\n\r\nOld\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86924018-2a912380-c12f-11ea-84a2-f3ae5997dd7d.png)\r\n\r\nNew\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86924044-354bb880-c12f-11ea-9a6e-bd0c1e65b2d4.png)\r\n\r\nThe new input should reuse more of our css vars, and look like before to be better integrated. \r\n\r\nAt least the background of the search input should be the same as the background of the dark mode toggle, exactly like you have on your own DocSearch site:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86924210-717f1900-c12f-11ea-8f8e-03eb3695a03e.png)\r\n\r\nThe modal colors also don't really match our existing theme (but we could handle that in another PR)\r\n\r\n## theme validation\r\n\r\nThere is a new system to validate/normalize theme options, using a Joi schema. It's not necessary to emit warnings in components if we are sure that options are valid.\r\n\r\nWould you like to work on proper validation system for Algolia options?\r\n\r\nWe could handle that in another PR, as this new validation system is optional, and we have contributors in this repo willing to help and familiar with the new validation system. \r\n\r\nBut you probably know more about how to validate DocSearch v3 options in a robust way, so let me know.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for your work, my focus is to get this merged asap, as it seems a great improvement.\r\n\r\nI think the PR can be merged as is, and we can handle the improvement work internally if you prefer, let me know.\r\n\r\nFor users that want to stay on v2, I think we should encourage the community to maintain its own v2 plugin: they could bootstrap it from latest v2 code from this repo (alpha.58 release is likely the last v2).\r\n\r\nThe main repo will try to always be up to date with DocSearch version. The community would archive/maintain older versions.","submittedAt":"2020-07-08T13:39:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-08T14:38:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"francoischalifour"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-20T08:58:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"francoischalifour"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-20T08:58:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"francoischalifour"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-22T09:47:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"francoischalifour"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-07-22T09:48:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Shipow"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"LGTM, great work ^^","submittedAt":"2020-07-23T10:08:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"yangshun"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-05-27T08:36:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"yangshun"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tried the runme link, it doesn't work.","submittedAt":"2020-05-25T17:15:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"yangshun"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks but we prefer to show a [demo of Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation) instead.

'/docs/legacyDocPathFrom2016'],\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      to: '/docs/newDocPath',\r\n      from: ['/docs/oldDocPathFrom2019', '/docs/legacyDocPathFrom2016'],\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      to: '/docs/newDocPath',\r\n      from: ['/docs/oldDocPathFrom2019', '/docs/legacyDocPathFrom2016'],\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the way, is it possible to use `fromExtensions`/`toExtensions` and `createRedirects` **together**? In one case, I added redirects in migration purposes, but later I needed to make a new redirect for a specific page (for example, I refactored docs a little bit).","submittedAt":"2020-06-03T08:15:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-06-03T10:55:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lex111"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-06-03T12:35:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"slorber"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2020-06-04T12:49:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lex111"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yangshun can you review the docs?","submittedAt":"2020-06-08T07:27:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"yangshun"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this @slorber.

I really like that you made it generic! Thank you @SamChou19815! \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about adding a new prop to `<Tabs />` called `groupKey`? The presence of this prop means that that all the `Tabs` instance of this `groupKey` wants to be grouped and updated together. With such a `groupKey`, a few problems with the current approach is solved:\r\n\r\n- The current choices data structure doesn't know which Tabs it originally belongs to and there might be collisions with new Tabs of different purpose but have the same value (chances are slim but you never know).\r\n- Allows saving each individual choice in its own localStorage key instead of stringifying the entire choices object (e.g. `docusaurus.tabs.operating_system`, `docusaurus.tabs.package_manager`). Also eliminates the possibility of a corrupted value for one groupKey affecting the other groupKeys.\r\n\r\nLemme know your thoughts!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just read the comments above and realized my suggested approach was exactly what you did. @lex111 I believe using a `groupId`/`groupKey` is better for engineering stability and maintainability even if it requires more work from the user.

I apologize for the following:\r\n\r\n- For taking so long to get back to you. Work has been really hectic and I'm busy getting my last minute #impacc for the half.\r\n- My earlier comment that theme would automatically update was incorrect. `useTheme` would not sync state across components - I completely forgot that `useTheme` uses `useState`, and component state is local. I found out that by doing `useTheme` in so many components in our code, we were initializing theme state around 7 times on certain pages (once for each codeblock). That's completely unnecessary and unintended. The proper way was for theme to be part of context. Heck, even the React context examples used theme as their example.\r\n\r\nI'm not in favor of the event bus as a communication mechanism because the theme value is clearly part of state and we should use an idiomatic React approach.\r\n\r\nI considered a few approaches, including listening to the `window.localStorage` changes and syncing the theme state across components, but the `window.addEventListener('storage', ...)` API doesn't allow listening for events on the same page. Hence I settled on creating a theme context that can be used by every component which needs the theme. \r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n- Individual components now have control over the theme and can set the theme and update all places which are relying on that theme context/state.\r\n- No duplicated theme state across components. It's all the way at the top of the component tree in the theme context provider\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\n- I had to inject the theme provider in `<Layout/>`. People who swizzled layout will not get the updates or their code might even break. Thankfully it's just a one-line change on their part and they can easily move to this theme context approach.\r\n- Users who create their own layout need to explicitly use the theme provider as well for theming functionality, whereas the event bus approach doesn't have to, as there is no central state (distributed across the components which use it).\r\n\r\nI'm unable to push to your PR branch, so I made a new one on this repo and the changes can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/commit/f708ed849b3f54adfd2c14ab8e7b4f4545040a8e).
