> Fix is kinda ugly, baseUrl things are a bit of a pain

Not sure to understand what you mean here. What is ugly and what is a pain?

> moreover now we have 2 separate datas, the one from `getAuthorsMap` in `loadContent` and `authorsMap` in `contentLoaded`

What is the problem? We need to define at which step this baseUrl gets applied. There are many possible solutions, including applying later when creating the props. 

I think applying it earlier in authors map is fine and consistent with the way we deal with baseUrl in many places currently.

When you have 2 big if/else branches like this, in reality you should have 2 components instead of one.

Remember it's a plugin. Instead of trying to shoehorn more behavior to it, the solution might instead be to create your own custom image plugin, and your own React component to render what your custom loader gives you.

- The `/authors` page is always created.
- The authors page only contains info in `authors.yml`, in the order they are declared
- Individual author pages are opt-in via `page: true` or `page: [slug]`

If so I think the following questions need to be answered in docs:

- Can I make inline authors appear in the authors page?
- How do I make every author get a page by default?
- Can partially overridden author information be prioritized over `authors.yml`?
- If an author is declared in `authors.yml` but in one post appears inline without a `key` reference, does that mean this post would not be attributed towards the author?

However we try to keep the docs short and concise, not to explain every MDX quirk in depth. There's the MDX docs for that. 

The warning is way too visible and draw way too much attention to it while most readers shouldn't care much. I'd prefer to remove the warning entirely. If you want to keep it, make it short (max 3 lines) and add a link to relevant MDX docs page. If it's not documented on MDX, make a doc PR to MDX instead. If they don't accept the doc PR, then link to the GitHub issue/discussion explaining the problem. If details must be included, hide them by default in a `<details>` element to make them less visible.

You see the idea. The goal is not for the docs to become too long because every one document every quirk ever encountered üòÖ We care about the experience of reading the docs more than the exhaustiveness of it. Sometimes not having something in the doc is a feature, not a bug.

Your 3-form string gets splitter into:

Then we run this JS Intl standard API with the number of items as parameter to get the correct plural form to render:

Our new policy for adding new deployment platforms in this page is to simply link to an external official resource explaining how to deploy Docusaurus to that platform, instead of explaining things in our own docs directly.

This way, we put the burden on the platform owners to ensure their Docusaurus deployment guide remains relevant.

Example: https://deploy-preview-10011--docusaurus-2.netlify.app/docs/deployment/#deploying-to-kinsta

If you are not from Stormkit, or not willing to create such official guide, I'd prefer to close this PR

That would also be nice to have an extra test in `index.test.ts` to cover the fact that the `processBlogPost` option has an impact on the plugin loadContent result.

For example, take a simple site with 10 blog posts, page size = 3, and provide a `processBlogPosts` that only take the 4 first blog posts in the list: the resulting number of pages should be 2 instead of 4. 

This kind of test ensures the plugin works overall, and covers the fact that `applyProcessBlogPosts` is called before `blogPosts.filter(shouldBeListed)`, which is important otherwise we would have a bug.","2024-02-26T11:17:01Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Yes it should support plural forms.

Unfortunately other languages will have to be fixed too because the string does not contain all plural forms, but that's not your responsibility to fix, and other languages should keep working as is (ie render as before a possibly wrong label)

BTW if you speak Russian, it would be a good opportunity to check the existing translations, notably this one missing plural forms:

To be honest I'm not super fan of merging this for a few reasons.

Notably the readme is not super clear on how it works, and as the Docusaurus maintainer I had to look at your source code to try to figure out how this seems to work, and I'm still not 100% sure. So a regular user would likely struggle to understand too. 

Things such as the ""published"" front matter should rather be clearly explained otherwise people would have to retro-engineer your lib.

Similarly you use GHA workflow_dispatch, so it seems this process is kind-of manual?

---

More importantly, I don't think this is the right thing to do. 


If you want to keep exclude some blog posts from the blog until a certain date, we have a better option for that: [`blogOptions.exclude`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog#exclude).

You could read the blog posts in your config file, and compute a `blogOptions.exclude` dynamically option based on front matter fields

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Maybe extending `sortPosts` is not the API we want, and instead, it would be better to directly implement a `processBlogPosts()` hook (or any other name?). 

Technically it would do the same, but the name would be broader, not limited to sorting.

What do you think @OzakIOne @Josh-Cena @ilg-ul ?

The way I see it, the existing `sortPosts` preset option would be applied earlier because it's less powerful. 
```js

let blogPosts = await loadBlogPosts();
blogPosts = applySortPreset(blogPosts,options.sortPosts); 
blogPosts = applyProcessing(blogPosts,options.processBlogPosts); 
// ...

Eventually we could later deprecated `options.sortPosts` considering you can already sort posts with `options.processBlogPosts`

Is ""the default value is"" comment really necessary? 
Our doc is not here to explain what Mermaid default values are. 
The only reason I'm willing to merge this PR is because the example value we have in our docs is dumb and useless. Technically I'd merge this for any value > 1000, not necessarily the default. 

Also, I technically can't merge this PR if you don't sign the CLA, that's a legal requirement from Meta

This only works in some cases and does not feel super robust either, and we'll have to handle the users complaining about things it does not support.

I'd prefer to explore another solution: what if we didn't stringify the headings in the first place?

What if we converted headings to JSX instead?

The TOC structure could look like:

```js
export const toc = [
  {
    ""value"": <>Doc Heading</>,
    ""id"": ""doc-heading"",
    ""level"": 2
  }, 
  ...__tocPartial(props),
]

There would be no good way for this remark plugin to report cases such as:

```js
<Link id=""customId""/>

[link to custom id](#customId)
```

So, this remark plugin would report a false positive error while the other ""slower"" broken link checker would not report it.

It's probably working but the code flow is not super clear, I'd appreciate if you refactor it a bit more.

For example `getSource` should probably get a clear `language: ""javascript"" | ""typescript""` attribute instead of overridden cli options

That's a good idea to do this upgrade for Docusaurus v3

We'll also have to update the docs as well:
- https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/code-blocks
- https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/themes/configuration

We'll also want to upgrade react-live to avoid a duplicate prism version. React-Live v4 uses prism-react-renderer v2
https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live
Supersed this PR: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/6589

Also we'll need some notes to explain users how to handle this breaking change. Can you write down some notes to explain what users should do when upgrading, and link to relevant external resources explaining breaking changes in depth?

Also related but apparently react-live upgrade breaks SSR support, and regression is still not fixed today (cf https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/6246#issuecomment-1119188530). Is it safe to upgrade or can it annoy our users? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We need to study that.

That looks like a good start but is not enough to be merged for a few reasons.

In case it wasn't clear: the goal is not to add XSLT just for our own website, but to build it as a feature for any Docusaurus site to have by default. 

It needs to be modular and it needs to work well out of the box on any Docusaurus site, without conflicting with existing user static assets. My suggestion would be to output the xslt/css next to the feeds, under `/blog/` for example, so that it is namespaced and we can use 2 blogs with different CSS/XSLT files.

Your PR is not really in a state I could merge, and try to implement things that are not really needed according to Google recommendations.

I can't be sure the translations are good but I notice errors on the plural forms.

Please read this part to understand how to handle plurals:
https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3526

Uzbek only has 2 cardinal plural forms, according to
- this page: https://www.unicode.org/cldr/cldr-aux/charts/34/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html
- the browser Intl API data

Thus, your pluralized translations should only contain 2 parts and not 3.

Also the placeholders should not be translated

You can keep `phP` or something like that in the additional languages of this PR so that we can make PHP work in the preview and be able to validate the PR without running local modifications. We are tracking screenshots and do visual regression tests of our pages now so that's a good way for us to ensure that this feature keeps working over time if we actually use it on our site.

This should rather be handled in `theme/SiteMetadata` (theme) instead of `SiteMetadataDefaults` because supporting og locale attributes is opinionated, shouldn't be mandatory for users and we should give them the ability to remove support if they don't want it (which would reduce the size of the html pages).

Is there a live Docusaurus sample site with Markprompt that we can check? @michaelfester said there was but couldn't find it. 

The example repo is nice but not having a live site available makes it harder to see what it looks like if we have to create a new Docusaurus site and install things locally.

Couldn't this benefit other MDX-based sites as well (like Next.js/Astro?). I feel it does not really belong in Docusaurus core.

Couldn't we use a theme-common helper component for those that want to create a FAQ? Your solution here looks much simpler: https://johnnyreilly.com/docusaurus-structured-data-faqs-mdx#the-faqstructureddata-mdx-component

My thoughts recently: we should process the MD AST with a remark plugin to swap links instead of using regexes to preprocess the string content of the doc. It would be cleaner, simpler to handle only valid markdown links, and faster to run.

> prefer-ideal-image: ensures @theme/IdealImage is used instead of img tags

---

We should allow any string link coming from props, dynamic or hardcoded values:

```tsx
<img src=""https://github.com/xyz.png"" />

<img src={`${props.githubUrl}.png`} />

<img src=""./xyz.png"" />

<img src={useBaseUrl(""./xyz.png""} />


const imgSrc = ""./xyz.png""
<img src={imgSrc} />
```

Eventually, add an option to reject relative local links?

The only patterns that IMHO we can safely reject are the usage of images that are required/imported locally:

```tsx
import imgSrc from './path/to/img.png';

<img src={imgSrc} />

<img src={require(""./img.png"")}/>
```

The weird chalk build errors you get are a bug that I will fix.

You can get the real errors by turning `disableInDev: false,` in the plugin options

That probably solves your use-case, but I think this API is a bit awkward and not the most flexible either.

Reading the docs, it's not so clear to me what `versionPrefix` even is üòÖ

I'd prefer if we worked on designing the API we want first before doing the implementation.

For now, I think this API is more flexible than yours and less confusing:

```js
[
  ""@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs"",
  {
    id: ""ios"",
    path: ""./ios-docs/v-next"",
    versionPath: ({version}) => `./ios-docs/v-${version.toLowerCase().replace(""."",""-""}`,
  },
];
```

---

Note: we already have a version config map so we could also reuse it to allow configuring the fs path? 

There's a bit of confusion between version route path and fs path unfortunately ü§™ 


See https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#ex-config

```tsx
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs',
      {
        path: 'docs',
        versions: {
          current: {

It looks good to me and loads much faster than before.

We can do this if you think it's better, just curious what's the main outcome for our users using this new technology? Is it stable enough? 

Also, do you offer a simple markdown editing + git commit interface like StackBlitz CodeFlow?

We might want to integrate something like this in our ""edit this page"" button, presenting a modal with multiple choices to edit.

On your preview, the problem is still present for all other Docusaurus pages that do not present the sidebarAd component. Just scroll a few pixels of the main scrollbar to see the issue:

The plural forms are wrong, they should only contain 4 values instead of 5.

function getLocalePluralForms(locale) {
  const AllPluralForms = ['zero','one','two','few','many','other']
  const pluralCategories = new Intl.PluralRules(locale).resolvedOptions().pluralCategories;
  pluralCategories.sort((c1,c2) => AllPluralForms.indexOf(c1) > AllPluralForms.indexOf(c2) ? 1 : -1);
  return pluralCategories;

const myLocale = ""sl""; // Change this variable!
console.log(""Plural forms for this locale are =>>> "",getLocalePluralForms(myLocale));

```
Plural forms for this locale are =>>>  (4)¬†['one', 'two', 'few', 'other']

Can't be sure but my intuition is that you should merge the 3rd and 4th plural forms because they all use the same suffix for 3 and 4 quantities: ""{count} prispevki"" / ""{count} minute branja"" / ""{count} dokumenti imajo oznako"" / ""{count} dokumenti najdeni""

"0916dhkim","CONTRIBUTOR","# Changes Summary
Current implementation does not update `selectedValue` when there is a query parameter or local storage change (only restores on mount). That's why tab group sync is not working.

Because selected tab is stored in React state, local storage, and query params, I thought it would be helpful to manage all three in `tabGroupChoice.tsx` module.

#### New structure
```ts

This PR is complicated for me to review/merge for a few reasons:
- It doesn't explain what's your motivation (ie PR doesn't explain what is unclear exactly in the current docs)
- It does 2 things at once (extract a new docs page + rewrite some parts of the docs), making the diff review more complicated for me
- It doesn't provide a consistent experience with the blog plugin 

I'm not against extracting a new docs page, but I'd prefer this doc update to be done in 2 steps:
- 1st PR focus on the actual content, making it consistent for both docs/blog plugins
- 2st PR eventually extract a new dedicated docs/blog page

The collapse button is supposed to remain visible with/without the announcement bar, and the scrollbar position should also be correct.

Making this work probably requires a more complex refactor of our layouts. 

Not sure exactly what should be done, unfortunately, but my intuition think using this CSS var is not the correct solution:

```js
margin-bottom: var(--docusaurus-announcement-bar-height);

We should rather have some dogfood cases to see it in action.

---

Note that we should also take care of the UI aspect. 

For example, suppose the blog sidebar highlights the currently browsed blog post. In that case, it should probably keep being highlighted if we browse it from the permalink URL or any of the aliases. The theme code probably doesn't account for this yet. There are also things to consider like navbar items highlighting, although people rarely link to blog post URLs from the navbar and can use the regexp active fn.

---

An alternative implementation that is likely faster than rendering twice the same blog post could be to just copy the static file in the build output, inside the `postBuild` hook?

```js
cp build/blog/folder/myBlogPost.html build/blog/another-folder/myBlogPostAlias.html
```

Pro: much faster if there are many aliases (unlikely? ü§î )
Cons: worst DX, aliases not working in dev unless we implement something. A Hybrid solution could also make sense.

We can probably think about perf later, and current implementation is likely good enough.

Actually, I'd like to avoid such deps upgrade PRs just before a release, particularly when any new deps version can cause problems.

I'm ok to merge this PR (once fixed), but not really to backport it for the v2.2 release of today

Eventually, it can be backported in a 2.3 release later (if we even need it, we might as well have 3.0-beta next)

New minor versions are for things that are really stable. We need time to be sure these deps upgrades do not contain any unwanted side-effect.

Not good enough to merge as is.

Sync between groups is now broken: https://deploy-preview-8225--docusaurus-2.netlify.app/docs/markdown-features/tabs/#syncing-tab-choices

I'd rather not serialize as JSON.

I'd also prefer if we opt-in for querystring serialization instead of making it a default

What I'd do:
- provide `queryString: string | boolean` prop
- false by default => no querystring
- true => use groupId as querystring param
- string => use value as querystring param

Unfortunately, I don't think this qualifies as a contribution.

If you want to find issues to work on, I encourage you to take time browsing through our [issue backlog](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues), especially those with labels welcoming PRs.

For some reason GitHub doesn't render diff properly on the CLI tests so I can't review through GitHub, will have to check the code locally üòì

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Thanks, that looks like a useful change that I'll classify as a bug fix (and not a breaking change)

Note we already have a convention to detect ""category index documents"", see 

```js
// By convention, Docusaurus considers some docs are ""indexes"":
// - index.md
// - readme.md
// - <folder>/<folder>.md
//
// This function is the default implementation of this convention
//
// Those index docs produce a different behavior
// - Slugs do not end with a weird ""/index"" suffix
// - Auto-generated sidebar categories link to them as intro
export const isCategoryIndex: CategoryIndexMatcher = ({
  fileName,
  directories,
}): boolean => {
  const eligibleDocIndexNames = [
    'index',
    'readme',
    directories[0]?.toLowerCase(),
  ];
  return eligibleDocIndexNames.includes(fileName.toLowerCase());
};
```

It makes sense to find a way to reuse the same logic instead of duplicating it.

We also want to cover such subtle behaviors with unit tests

Also note that with autogeneated sidebars, folders might have a number prefix for ordering reasons, and you may want to strip that number in the infered title: `/xx/yy/03-zz/index.md` should infer to `zz` and not `03-zz`? (see impl of `getSlug()` for inspiration)

Please make sure the error is displayed nicely, maybe keep the ""results"" header tab, and ensure there's still the padding/background?

"Josh-Cena","COLLABORATOR","Unfortunately, PnP tests failed‚Äîbecause the MDX files will get compiled to JSX files containing something like

```js
/* @jsxRuntime classic */
/* @jsx mdx */
/* @jsxFrag React.Fragment */

import React from ""react"";
import { mdx } from ""@mdx-js/react"";

const layoutProps = {
  
};
const MDXLayout = ""wrapper""
export default function MDXContent({
  components,
  ...props
}) {
  return <MDXLayout {...layoutProps} {...props} components={components} mdxType=""MDXLayout"">
    <h1>{`Hello`}</h1>
    </MDXLayout>;
}

;
MDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;
```

Because of the `/* @jsx mdx */` pragma, `@mdx-js/react` is in fact implicitly depended on by the user's site. Theoretically, we could import from the absolute path of `@mdx-js/react` with something like

```js
const code = `
${pragma}
import React from 'react';
import { mdx } from `${require.resolve(""@mdx-js/react"")}`;

${exportsCode}
${result}
`;
```

But AFAICT, that's discouraged because you should not have absolute paths in loaders' compiled output, which is bad for persistent caching in Webpack.

If you'd like to figure out a better approach in this PR, feel free to... I want to get rid of this as well, so users don't get constantly confused before we migrate to MDX v2.","2022-08-03T01:29:51Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Hey @gabrielcsapo , sorry for the delay üòÖ hard to catch up with all PRs to review.

I suggested a webpack solution here: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/7737#issuecomment-1178894001

You said it could work for your use-case, but you'd prefer not couple to Webpack:
https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/7737#issuecomment-1179336440

At the same time, is the concept of ""postStart"" something that many bundlers share? 

This project is trying to create a unified abstraction on top of multiple bundlers and doesn't have that concept for example, so will it really be more portable? https://github.com/unjs/unplugin

""start"" what exactly? The HTTP port, the bundler, the watchers, the first compilation? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That's not clear to me. Can you reference docs of other bundlers having a similar concept?

Honestly, I'd rather see you implement the Webpack proprietary solution first: this would allow me to inspect it to understand better what you are trying to do, and in particular what files/data you need to read and when.

As far as I understand it, you want to use it to generate your search index. Don't you want to re-generate it as well on any markdown file edit? Wouldn't it be confusing for users to have a local search that ""almost works"" locally but not completely? Wouldn't it be better to use the same logic and timing for both dev/prod?

As I don't know the code you plan to implement, it's hard to understand if it's a good decision to add this new hook. And I'd rather not introduce officially a hook to figure out later that it's finally not the solution to your problem: a userland solution (or marking the API as experimental/secret) permits to avoid that.

There are things to consider, for example the fact that the bundler may start after the postStart hook (lazily on first request), or simply that we might turn on [`experiments.lazyCompilation`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/experiments/#experimentslazycompilation) in the future in which the app compilation will happen in multiple steps. It might not be a problem for your specific use-case, but can become confusing for other use-cases.

---

I read some code in https://github.com/gabrielcsapo/docusaurus-plugin-search-local/blob/main/src/server/utils/postBuildFactory.ts

As far as I understand you are reading emitted HTML files. Those files won't be emitted with the dev server. I'd really like to know what's your plan in this case. Seeing a working userland implementation prototype (even if coupled to Webpack) would help understand all this better.

Thinking from first principles, it doesn't seem to me parsing HTML files with cheerio is the right solution. We should expose local search plugins to some kind of data layer for them to create a similar index in dev/prod. Ideally the index should support hot reload and be fast, and well-integrated with the bundler caching system.

For this to happen we'll likely need to create our own Docusaurus local search plugin (which we want) otherwise it's hard to figure out the correct public API to expose without the ability to experiment.

Hope this makes sense

One question is about TypeScript types. What accounts as ""safe""? For example, does changing a type from non-generic to generic count as breaking? Two generic arguments to three? `string` to a literal union? Or only removal of types counts? Are _all_ exported types stable? (e.g. we have a lot of types in `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs/lib/sidebars/types`) Should we split `@docusaurus/types` into `/internal` as well? ","2022-07-01T05:34:49Z",false,"APPROVED"

Something to consider: I think the ""category generated index"" name may not be very clear and users might not understand how it looks like visually. 

Can we display an example index on that page?

https://deploy-preview-7665--docusaurus-2.netlify.app/docs/sidebar/items/#generated-index-page

Like `<BrowserWindow><SampleGeneratedIndex/></BrowserWindow>`

Just to make it clear what it looks like?

"Josh-Cena","COLLABORATOR","My idea is we don't have to be too conservative about marking APIs as public. General utilities should definitely be public. I feel like we should have more public APIs than internal ones. I marked those that I have the strongest opinions about, but we need to think about every one of them, probably make a ranking.

Some other thoughts:

1. We definitely can select certain ""interesting"" utilities to document while only keeping others retro-compatible (i.e. safe for eject) without documentation
2. ""Public"" can mean three things:
    - External theme authors are encouraged to use these
    - Site creators are encouraged to use these in their custom pages
    - Safe for swizzle eject

"Josh-Cena","COLLABORATOR","When we were discussing over Discord, I'm not really sure whether we want a simple env var that toggles minification on/off, or a full config option. I'm strongly leaning towards the former because it isn't that well-used at all and making that many options for it seems like an overkill. Remember that we try to minimize the API surface as much as possible.

That's my strong opinion, not sure about @slorber's, but I think we definitely need to use env vars instead, maybe even 6 env vars, but never a config option.","2022-06-08T03:33:40Z",false,"COMMENTED"

I doubt if it really happens in practice that users have unpaired quotes in their path names, and less so that it leads to command injection. But I've thought about the same.

As for execa vs. shelljs, I think our very simple approach to sanitize the input will suffice. All input is from the user and we should trust that there's no intentionally constructed injection. But it seems execa is also more lightweight (half the install size of shelljs in a fresh repo, not sure how much it would be in our monorepo).

@webbertakken the problem is: this solution works for the blog, but it won't work in all situations

Please provide a better test plan than this video. I'd like to see this solution in practice on our own website for all content plugins (docs, blog, jsx page, mdx page), so that we can easily test and review it ourselves on desktop and mobile using various browser settings.

You can use the dogfooding folder to add test pages

Also remember that users may implement custom pages, and similarly to the docs plugin, the content may not be centered. This new CSS workaround shouldn't mess-up with existing user pages.

I'd rather add it with more granularity to docs, blog and pages classes instead of this shared main wrapper ","2022-05-27T09:53:18Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

However we also used dynamic imports so that the reload popup does not need to be loaded eagerly. Implemented initially in https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/2205

Afaik we had 2 dynamic imports

```js
const renderReloadPopup = (await import('./renderReloadPopup')).default;
```

```ts
  const {default: ReloadPopup} = await import(process.env.PWA_RELOAD_POPUP!);
```

> The dynamic import used to import the reload popup component has caused problems with server-side rendering due to how Babel/SWC compiles it. See https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/3742 and https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/7329 for some struggles. I propose to simply remove this option, because we can leverage swizzling to achieve the same effect.

It's still not clear to me why this is a problem, and which one is the actual problem (both?). The issues didn't really help me. Can you explain? If this is a Babel problem, how does it compile it exactly and how should it compile it?


Can we keep the lazy behavior and still fix the issue?

I'm ok to simplify if it fixes things, but I also like to understand the issue if possible ü§™ ","2022-05-27T08:57:13Z",false,"APPROVED"

"Josh-Cena","COLLABORATOR","TBH, the UX is not great as I see it. The same label is repeated twice, which is what we are trying to avoid, both here and for the versions dropdown. What's lacking is the active link highlight color:

<img width=""408"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55398995/168541446-89025191-42e4-4c18-a8af-61e2aeca39a0.png"">

In addition to the gray background, we need to apply the primary color. The problem is that the `dropdown__link--active` is overridden by `menu__link`:

We need to use `menu__link--active` instead of `dropdown__link--active` on mobile, as we did for the regular navbar dropdowns (through the `getInfimaClassName` function)

- Many legacy doc sites moving to Docusaurus want to preserve older canonical urls for SEO. We have users that explicitly want to use `.html` in router paths (I even recommended some users to use `slug: /xyz.html` for site migration purposes) => we should dogfood this and ensure it keeps working, not stripping the extension if the route actually exists.

- This page renders better than before but produces FOUC after hydration: https://deploy-preview-7184--docusaurus-2.netlify.app/docs/installation.html , unlike https://deploy-preview-7184--docusaurus-2.netlify.app/docs/installation => that seems unexpected to me, but we'd rather fix it","2022-04-20T16:16:51Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

IMO the goal is to _reduce_ coupling between navbar items and navbar layout instead of hardcoding more special items, because it's in our plan to make every navbar item configurable (see also #7154 for one such confusion)

What about unifying the padding/margin for every navbar item? We have a similar problem for the color mode toggle as well.","2022-04-13T03:38:50Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Thanks for the initial work on this @seyoon20087

Unfortunately the peer deps issues should rather be solved and the hydration mismatches fixed (or at least inspected to see if it's legacy or appeared with the upgrade)

---

Also, note that it's not really the responsibility of external contributors to do major upgrades like this, and that it may also not be the best timing. It's preferable to reach out and ask if the PR is welcome before starting to work on this on your own üòÖ


On my side, the focus is on shipping 2.0, and React 18 is not necessarily a top priority atm. Docusaurus users do not care much about using the latest cutting-edge version of React, and upgrading now is more likely to cause troubles to our ecosystem than solving problems.

This upgrade is more likely to be released in another major like 3.0 alongside MDX 2 and other deps that are still using React 17. And we'll be able to communicate on it better in a detailed blog post.

So, it's up to you if you want to keep working on this and investigate the remaining issues, but keep in mind that it's POC work atm and it's unlikely I'll merge this very soon.","2022-04-07T17:59:56Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

The announcement label template should rather be translatable, and this does not really belong in core

This is a quite significant UX change, wonder if we shouldn't poll our community about it?

Some sites might be annoyed by this change, particularly those that want to keep a larger theme toggle instead of a theme switch button (for example https://supabase.com/docs ?)

This is not so easy for users to revert to the old behavior too if they want that.

Wonder if we shouldn't have a broader redesign of the mobile theme design, including the API

For example maybe we should be able to set a smaller label for mobile? or having another array of navbar items dedicated for mobile? ","2022-03-24T10:33:09Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

When I implemented the button, I was largely unsure whether a button or a checkbox has better semantics.

But since we have aria label, I think it's actually better as a button üëç","2022-03-17T08:39:59Z",false,"APPROVED"

I'm not skilled enough in a11y to tel if a button or checkbox is better so I trust you there

I'd like to refactor the props API before merging

Note I'd like to eventually allow this color mode switch to work without JS/hydration (not a very high priority though), and it might require a checkbox in the future, but it's not very important for now, just wanted to let you know ;)

We choose to default to Yarn whenever possible because we just feel that Yarn is _objectively_ a better package manager than NPM, and it's also used by ourselves, which means the chances that package managers freaking out will be the lowest for Yarn (for example, it's the most lenient towards unmet peer dependencies).

`npm init` and `yarn create` are certainly indicative enough of package manager preferences, but `npx` was only written there because `npm init` doesn't work in all cases. We meant to make it a replacement for both `npm init` and `yarn create`. In this case, I don't want to default to NPM.

The thing I like about this PR is being able to use PNPM as default, as mentioned in #6631. Maybe we should also recursively look up the directories and try to find a lockfile? Does that make sense in all cases?","2022-02-15T01:34:15Z",false,"COMMENTED"

To me this looks fine to apply this by default, as content images are less important to load compared to other images (like layout images)

Later we'll introduce an official core `<Img>` component in Docusaurus and it's a common practice to add some IntersectionObserver logic to make it load eagerly images that are close to entering the viewport (similar to links/idealImage)

Note users that want to disable lazy loading can still disable this thanks to a remark plugin. It's not very convenient/elegant but it's just erasing `loading=""lazy""` from the image jsx string.

I think we can ship this by default and see if anyone complains, to eventually revert or provide an option.

My only concern: do we want lazy loading for images we couldn't compute width/height? Not sure when this happens but it may lead to annoying layout shifts as the user scrolls down.

Any opinion @Josh-Cena ?","2022-02-04T11:15:21Z",false,"APPROVED"

> @Josh-Cena @slorber So what's the plan

The plan is to ship 2.0 ü§™ sorry but I can't make this PR a high priority (as it's not mandatory for landing 2.0) and neither merge it blindly, so this may take a bit more time.

I'd like to get this merged before 2.0 though, and that seems reasonable to get it merged soon considering it looks to work nicely

Note: there are still a few refs to react-live in the docs. I'd rather not mention too much the underlying lib and make it an implementation detail.","2022-02-09T16:43:45Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

I'm not sold on the `nested` config, maybe we could figure out a better name? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Do we want this config to be themeConfig or plugin option? (ie 2 plugins can have different options? ü§™ )

What if later we add breadcrumbs to blog posts? (like `2021 > Docusaurus Recap` or something), will the themeConfig still make sense in such case? Shouldn't we make it clear that it only impacts the docs?

I don't know all the internals of your plugin, was wondering if in the future we couldn't find a way to make it work by extending the docs plugin? maybe having a way to somehow create ""virtual mdx files"" or something?

Is having 2 booleans the best frontmatter model?

---

Is ""unlisted"" the best term? Maybe hidden or secret can also be nice?

---

Can you add tests to the `_dogfooding` folder please so that we can review this more easily?

https://docusaurus.io/tests/docs

- autogen: normal doc + draft + unlisted
- explicit sidebar: normal doc + draft + unlisted

I'd also like to have cases covering draft/unlisted on category link / index docs (explicit or autogen)

What if  autogen + `category/index.md` has `draft: true` for example? We should probably ""erase"" the link from the sidebar category in this case (+ tests üòâ )

---

We want feature parity with docs and blog, and keep PRs small.

Maybe it is better to split this in 2: one PR for draft, one for unlisted?

Later we'll add another PR for unlisted on both blog + docs? 

For ""unlisted"" we need to figure out sitemaps + noIndex + eventually find a way to remove links for navbar/footer.... there are more edge cases to consider and more code to write üòâ I think docs drafts can land sooner so it's worth it to split this

"Josh-Cena","COLLABORATOR","Overall I don't like Dependabot and I use Renovate for my projects, because Dependabot has no batch-updates and ends up sending 3 PRs to upgrade one monorepo (e.g. ts-eslint) which creates huge noise in our history. It also usually means waiting for Dependabot to resolve conflicts after merging every PR. But... seems we haven't progressed much with integrating Renovate.

Wonder what is the browser support for `nearest` and what is the behavior for browsers not supporting it?

Also maybe we should add this for the docs sidebar too? IE reveal sidebar items on activation, considering that next/prev nav may let the new item out of the view?

I'll check later to see if strict mode works

Changing the fork is a quite important change, considering the implementation is totally refactored. We'd rather have 2 separate PRs: one for the fork and one for strict mode

- Please don't choose ""favorite"" yourself‚Äîthat's for the maintainers to decide. I personally don't think this qualifies as favorite despite being very polished and complete.
- The URL should be pointing to `https://docs.tooljet.com/`, not a non-docusaurus page
- Removing the color mode toggle's icons is a bad idea. You'd rather use SVG icons or something else if you don't like the emojis.
- The admonitions don't work well in dark mode:

> This pr changes how svg files are stored in project and removes all css from them, this is first step to refactor how we import icons.

IMHO we should not do this in multiple steps, but in a single one, once we know exactly how we should handle the SVGs. This PR can serve as a POC to see if an approach is right.

This kind of change can be disruptive for our users with custom themes, and we should avoid doing 2 chances in 2 distinct releases when we can do only one.

---

The current approach is not good enough, the SVGs remain loaded through SVGR, converted to the same React components as before, and SVG markup is still duplicated in the final HTML

I don't know what is the best solution to this problem yet, just some ideas:
- Use `url('./icon.svg')` in CSS => this should use file-loader instead of SVGR due to usage in CSS
- Force usage of inline file-loader in JS file and use with `<img>` tag?

I asked a question here, some proposed approaches might be interesting to explore: https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1466024866491080707

Using SVG defs and SVG use also seems interesting, preferably if we can somehow lazy-load those refs instead of having a global registry

That looks better than what we currently have so I'm ok to merge this.

But I think it's not ideal yet for a user to make a decision very fast. I have some ideas to improve this page even more.

We'd probably benefit to separate Self-hosted, Jamstack & GitHub in separate sections, and have an ""other options"" section. An overview could list all options with a pros/cons sections, easier to scan than details/summary texts. Eventually we could provide some kind of comparison table in the overview.

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","That change seems reasonable to me.

We already have a `stylesheets` API to easily override global CSS. I guess CSS is added after infima + CSS modules? https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config#stylesheets

Also, should we keep `theme.customCss`, deprecate it, or change its behavior? with this change, `customCss` CSS will be loaded earlier than before (before theme CSS modules), which means that some unexpected CSS might become applied to user sites while it was not the case before ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . This may not impact us, but it may impact other highly customized websites like React-Native.

And yes, all this is Hyrum's law (https://www.hyrumslaw.com/) in practice: current users depend on our legacy wrong behavior. Some users may suffer from this change and we should aim to reduce their pain, by ensuring a well-defined order once for all with automated tests.

What I suggest:

PR 1: 
- Revert the error boundary in core to ensure we revert the CSS order issues to the former state (temporary)
- Dogfood usage of `stylesheets` on our own website and `theme.customCSS` on our own website, eventually add things like ""marker CSS classes"" that we can easily monitor like `.test-css-module {}` or `.test-stylesheets {}` or `.test-custom-css {}`
- Monitor CSS diff changes in our own website (inspired by https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima/pull/152?)
- Eventually add an automated test to ensure marker CSS classes are in a correct order

PR 2: 
- Do this client modules import change
- ensure that the monitored diff looks expected in terms of order, particularly that the marker CSS classes are in the correct order.
- Publish canary from PR
- Test on RN/Jest websites and see how painful it is for them to fix issues, create PRs that can help the community to migrate their CSS files

"Josh-Cena","COLLABORATOR","I believe this is safe. The deployment works like this:

- The source repository is cloned. If the clone happens through SSH (the repo URL is SSH), it means there's already an SSH key associated in the environment to carry out all further interactions with GitHub.
- The deploy command does the build.
- In case of a cross-repo publish, the deployment repo is cloned & checked out. If using HTTPS, GH will ask for the username & password for authentication; if using SSH, the clone will always succeed (just like cloning the source repo). **Note: the user here doesn't have to be the same that made the deployment commit. She just needs to have push access to the deployment repo.**
- The build output is committed to the deployment branch. It requires setting the git username & email locally, which is not handled by the deploy command itself. (I wonder if it's possible to also enable GPG signing)

In any case, we don't want to change the current API and avoid any breaking change.

Using a string remains the simple option for the end user, and Docusaurus should later handle it automatically by transforming it to an ImageObject: it should not be done by the user (or at least it should not be mandatory).

I suggest we could just forward additional props to the img element directly, and write in our own website config:

```
module.exports = {
  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      title: 'Site Title',
      logo: {
        src: 'img/logo.png',
        width: 50,
        height: 50,
        className: ""my-custom-logo""
      },
    },
  },
};
```

We'll figure out later how to automatically infer a good default width/height for the referenced FS image","2021-10-27T16:46:30Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Some feedback:

- Should we allow to click on the image or does it cause any trouble?

- What about allowing to click on card tags? Does it lead to a weird UX?

- Should favorites still be at the beginning if tags are used? 

- Would it be easy to animate a bit the tooltip?

- Maybe we need a separator, at least for our light theme, because some screenshots have white background?

- I think we should normalize on card ratios, to avoid a weird offset:

(if images are not good enough we can update them, and eventually add a CI check to ensure a required image ratio? => this can be done in another PR)

We need to ensure TS types reflect the props needed (ie at least one of id or message, eventually both).

JS users should be protected against bad props usage with good error messages (ie passing `<div>` as children or passing no props at all)

Also not a fan of using `''` as fallback everywhere, please use something like `undefined` instead so that we don't lose the semantic meaning of a missing message. 

Once `''` are extracted, this could end-up in Git forever.

I don't under how this works yet, but it seems to work in a case we have on Docusaurus site:
- bad: https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog/#global-authors
- good: https://deploy-preview-5618--docusaurus-2.netlify.app/docs/blog/#global-authors
- good: http://localhost:3000/docs/blog#global-authors

Will need more time to test/review this properly but this seems pretty good.

Can you move all the code that is not coupled to the classic theme / Infima to the `theme-common` package? This will be useful in the future to provide multiple themes, all using this tab behavior.

- Not a fan of the package name, we should make it more generic
- Can we reuse code from babel cli for the watch mode (eventually call the cli?)? Is it really needed to implement our own? Is our implementation similar to Babel cli?
- Watch mode does not permit to work on theme with hot reload
- theme / js-theme: unnecessary duplication (main also duplicates, but it's a good opportunity to fix this)
- Build size bot reports important build size changes, any idea why?

`UserDocusaurusConfig` is nice but this is public API surface that we should also add in our doc and init templates JSDoc annotations.

Isn't it confusing to for users to have `UserDocusaurusConfig` (in config) + `DocusaurusConfig` (in code, pages etc...)?

There are other naming possibilities like `DocusaurusConfig` + `DocusaurusConfigNormalized`, which is better? 

Is there another better alternative?

Since this is a regular pattern to have partial user inputs that get normalized, we should find and stick to a shared convention for type names, particularly when they are documented as public API like in this case.

Feel free to merge as it's already an improvement compared to what we had.

https://deploy-preview-5386--docusaurus-2.netlify.app/tests/docs/tags/

What about:
- Using a single design/comp, with an optional `count` prop? That would allow customizing it more easily.
- Show tag count in a rectangle instead of a circle/oval

The arrow design is a bit too opinionated for me and I prefer something soberer, but it's probably my own tastes. As you want. In the doc page, it would probably be soberer without the count anyway so I don't know ü§™ 

The tag count in oval does not scale well to large numbers:

- I'd rather extract all that in a separate theme comp, so that users swizzling BlogPostItem have less code to maintain on their side

`activeSidebarClassName` should be added if the user browser a doc that is inside the same sidebar as the navbar doc item. 

This thing permits to enable a ""tab-like"" navbar item. In the following we can see that Component is highlighted when browsing the FlatList page, despite Components not directly linking to this FlatList page:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/127864373-8529c676-5922-4266-bf12-4ba432104ada.png)


I agree that the duplicated className should be solved, however the point of having this extra class was to give the possibility for the user to disable this tab-like behavior. What if the user does not want to highlight the Components navbar item when browsing the FlatList page? What if we should highlight the Components navbar item in a different way for the Components index page and the FlatList page? 

Forcing the existing Infima class means there's no way to opt-out of the tab-like styling behavior, which may not make sense in all cases.

As I'd like to introduce a navbar item of type `docSidebar` I think in the future we could even remove this tab-like behavior from item of type `doc` because the tab-like behavior would be a better fit for the `docSidebar` type?

As activeSidebarClassName is not used and is more complex than just a static className due to mobile, I agree we can remove it as a breaking change for now and see if anyone complains about this removal. If someone does, it's an opportunity to understand their use-case for it and figure out if a new `docSidebar` item type would solve it, or if we need to restore such an option.

- Element `table` not allowed as child of element `small` in this context. And in general it makes little sense to reduce font size in table at all.
- It is also better to move Default column right after Type. Many docs follow exactly this ordering of columns in similar tables (`name | type | default | description`).

That looks like a nice idea overall, but I'm not sure it would work in the current form, as each cached compiler will capture the first filepath being compiled.

Maybe there's a way for a remark plugin to access current file path being processed, without passing it through options?

We can see the problem in practice by building the Docusaurus site:

- What about using native smooth scrolling on browsers supporting it? And cancel the animation on the polyfill?
- The behavior is different from v1. Isn't it confusing to require scrolling up to show the button? This makes the new TOC less accessible (scroll up + press instead of just press)
- This comp does not depend too much on Infima, what about moving it to theme-common so that we can reuse it later in other themes?

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","I don't agree with that, `disableSwitch` only removes the toggle in the navbar, it does not prevent usage of dark mode.

`setDataThemeAttribute` must be called even if the toggle is hidden

- You might use `defaultMode: 'dark'`
- You might use `respectPrefersColorScheme: true` in which case it will change the color mode according to your system (even if the toggle is hidden)

There is potentially a case where this script is omitted but it's much smaller, like `disableSwitch && defaultMode === ""light"" && !respectPrefersColorScheme`. Not sure it's worth making the change ","2021-06-09T14:09:41Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

I'm not sure to understand what the problem is in the first place, and also why your solution is a good one.

Please give me context so that I understand better.

Also please add an example in one of our dogfooding pages, I suggest to add something in `src/pages/markdown-tests.md`, so that we are sure it works and that it keeps working over time.

I tried the following and it didn't seem to work

```
## Link to JSON file

- [manifest md link](@site/static/manifest.json)

- <a href={require(""@site/static/manifest.json"").default}>manifest jsx link</a>

I find this code starts to be a bit hard to follow, do you think we could refactor it to something simpler? My idea is to follow this recommendation and avoid using ""let"" reassignments: https://charles-stover.medium.com/replacing-let-with-const-86797b790775

I think 3 Hebrew plural forms are incomplete as they only handle 2 out of 4 possible plurals forms available in Hebrew. For a better i18n translation, can you please provide the 4 plural forms for these 3 labels?

I tried to update the doc here to explain this better: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3526

Let me know if it's not clear enough

Here are the plural rules for Hebrew:

Happy to add Qovery to the list of deployment options.

Can you make this more succinct? I'd rather have fewer instructions and a link to a more exhaustive tutorial hosted on Qovery website.

The current instructions do not look really good to me. If you want a step by step tutorial you'd better host that directly on Qovery and add screenshots.  I'd rather limit the ""click on"" instructions

Also please add Qovery at the very end after QuantCDN as you added it after it is weird to add it in the middle of the doc.

There's something that bothers: you moved all the theme types to `@docusaurus/types` but this type package is meant to be used for core types, not plugin/theme types, as these types are specific to one theme in particular, but some users might want to use Docusaurus with a totally different theme  with different types. That's why {} is a valid/default type and the core ThemeConfig should remain `Record<string,any>` or something similar. Note it's possible  to use Docusaurus with multiple themes at the same time, and we end up with a composition where the final theme config is the theme config of the 2 underlying themes (`ClassicThemeConfig & LiveCodeBlockThemeConfig`)

In practice, the plan is to share a common ThemeConfig type across multiple themes (classic/bootstrap/tailwind), but keep the core agnostic of those types, that's why the types were put in `@docusaurus/theme-common` 

For now, it's not necessary to take any care of the bootstrap theme, it is  not ready for usage at all.","2021-03-15T18:29:17Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Not sure we want to remove intl-locales-supported, we don't use it in the browser but we actually use it for Node 12 lack of full ICU support.

We thought with @lex111 it would be simpler to load a polyfill in Node than asking our users to add full-icu support to Node 12. This is just a temporary solution until we require Node 14 as minimum version, including full ICU support.

Your implementation is not correct because it assume the blog post content is a simple string, which is not the case in practice as we use MDX

Read my comment here. on how you could transform an MDX string to an HTML string:

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Same comment as on the PR by @ShinteiMai  

This page is way too verbose, we need something much more simple.

We don't need an exhaustive guide on how to deploy to GH pages, and particularly not a tutorial on how to automate this process with Github actions and the complicated CI script. This does not  really spark joy to the user but rather a headache üòÖ 

Basically, you just need to tell the user to run `npm run build`, and document the simplest way to get this site online.

- Self-host: `npm run serve` (no need to explain --port -- host options here or tell it's not performant)
- Github pages: tell the user to  add a minimal config and `npm run deploy` (don't show an exhaustive list of env variable options here, don't tell how to automate this)
- Netlify or Vercel: signup, run `npm run build` and then drag & drop the ./build folder

Try to remove useless wordings and keep it minimalistic, inspire yourself from the  1st part which was largely trimmed, and use an imperative tone.

We should rather tell the user exactly what to do, we should not really give him any options (apart from choosing a hosting solution), so avoid telling the user about any cli or env variable options","2021-03-14T17:24:25Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Not very satisfied with this solution, as it complicates the remark loader and I see a better way:
- let the remark plugin computes the TOC with infinite length
- handle the max depth at render time directly in the theme

This has advantages:
- simpler to implement and maintain
- no need to configure anything on the site
- depth for right TOC can be controlled by md frontmatter
- depth for inline TOC in MDX can be controlled by prop
- we can just use maxDepth=2 as default prop to the TOC theme component
- a theme config can set-up the default TOC depth for the whole site (not just the docs plugin)","2021-03-04T15:52:48Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Can we do extract messages for translation from attributes like `aria-label`?
Also can we take into account subthemes like `docusaurus-theme-search-algolia` (eg it contains input placeholder text ""Search"").","2021-02-11T17:22:20Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","I think the solution  and code added to solve the problem is too complex and suggested a simpler solution.

In my opinion the current implementation of Tabs is not very good, not idiomatic React, and should be refactored totally in the future. I'd preferably like to avoid adding too much complexity to tabs so that a future refactoring would be simpler to achieve, and so that we can invest in the ideal solution instead of a good enough one","2021-02-18T11:24:16Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Hi @josephriosIO , thanks for your work on this

There are a few things that do not look good to me:
- A map with labels as index is not a reliable solution to store the categories states (it does not look simple as we don't have any unique category id, and probably need some kind of recursive structure)
- The current UX looks weird to me (I guess it's quite subjective, maybe ask for feedbacks of your colleagues at Temporal about what they think about keeping the active category unfolded?)


For the animation, I didn't implement it and not 100% sure why the timeout was needed in the first place. I guess it could be restored by using a `useEffect()` somewhere, or maybe `const isCollapsedDebounced = useDebounce(isCollapsed,100)` ?  

Also, it'd be nice to update your PR and solve the conflicts with master

Let me know if you need any help (I can commit to your PR, that may be faster for me than writing down my ideas  as comments)","2021-01-27T16:41:22Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Alright, that's not the ideal implementation, but that seems good enough for now, so let's move on

> The only case we have to think twice about UX is when there are multiple sidebar categories expanded by default. In this implementation, the expandedItem context is initialized to null, and when the user collapses one of those default-expanded categories, the others remain expanded until any category is toggled to be expanded.

That's true there are a few unhandled edge cases, but most users will likely not notice them. 

We'll refactor this feature and make it more robust later.

Let's enable it on our own website for now to dogfood

But I'm very likely to turn this off later because for me it is a real pain to click on a category see it shift far away from your mouse cursor.","2022-01-20T15:37:30Z",false,"APPROVED"

As I wrote earlier, the URL must be used with offline mode enabled, then this error will not occur.

Also it is better for us to use the config file for Lighthouse, then we can exclude some checks that only distract attention:

- Page is blocked from indexing
- robots.txt is not valid
- Document does not have a valid

I did some changes on your code because:
- you reverted some important package.json changes
- your cleanup of example folder did not work reliably
- some ESLint rules didn't pass
- all files should have the FB copyright header
- the node init script should rather forward its logs to parent process, so that users knows something is happening

Otherwise it works fine.

Was wondering if purgecss couldn't be used for this usecase instead of custom postcss logic?

Also do we want to keep the 2 modification modes over time, or is it temporary? If we want to keep it, I don't really like the name of this option, and using boolean means we can't introduce easily a 3rd option in the future

I'd rather avoid having fn args list grow, a single option object is more suitable for long term maintenance.

Note: this is likely to conflict with my i18n branch, so try to avoid refactoring too much the build/start commands in general, until i18n is merged (https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/3325/files), as I still plan to modify these files.","2020-11-10T10:56:32Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Hi and thanks for completing my todo :) 
That looks pretty good overall.

There's for me one major problem: if you have 2 MD broken links and the throw config (recommended, default config), you might fail on first md broken link found. 
In such case only one broken link would be reported: the first one.

We'd rather find a way to aggregate all the md broken links here instead of failing fast asap? 
Maybe storing a mutable broken links list in the plugin, and reporting all the broken links once all the docs have been read?

If that's not possible, I'd rather have a 2nd option like siteConfig.onMarkdownBrokenLink or something, that would rather default to a warning, so that user might see all the md broken links in a single build attempt.

The important thing to me is that the user does not have to fail a build, fix 1 link, fail another build, fix another link etc... he should see all the broken links by default.

Does it make sense?","2020-10-30T14:06:33Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

I only handled the creation of the tas list page, you can proceed to create one specific page per tag in the same way.

Note each version has a:
- set of docs

I started separating theme/style components from behavioral ones, because we want at some point to support multiple themes (classic/bootstrap/tailwind...), all having the same UX (just the style and css system would change).

This code is likely to be shared between the 3 themes, and not meant to be swizzled, so I'd rather move it to src/client, until we create a new package with all the design-agnostic theme code. (there's outline none, but I think this still make sense for all themes to adopt this behavior)

Instead of adding the noindex meta from themes code, what about injecting the tag in a generic way directly in core (like, through the SSR template).  This way we are sure that this feature work consistently across all themes, including themes built by users/community

Also, we have a migration cli. If v1 had the noIndex option, that would be nice if running the migration cli did output a v2 website also having the noIndex option. You can test  this migration with `yarn test:v1Migration:migrate`

You didn't actually use the plugin you just created, because you still use the local site plugin in the config: 

```js
remarkPlugins: [require('./src/plugins/remark-npm2yarn')],
```

We should remove this local plugin, and change the config to use the new remark plugin:

```js
remarkPlugins: [""@docusaurus/remark-plugin-npm2yarn""],
```

(maybe require() is still required, don't know)

Without a new lifecycle like `getRemarkPlugins` or something, we currently don't have a way to make a docusaurus plugin provide a remark plugin that will be used for  all other plugins reading markdown files.

I suggest to keep it simple for now (and publish a remark plugin, not a docusaurus plugin), but in the future we'd rather figure out such an API, so that adding ""@docusaurus/plugin-npm2yarn"" would enable the npm2yarn feature for all plugins (docs, pages, blog...).","2020-10-14T12:46:40Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Thanks @imskr that almost look good.But there is a place where you read title/scroll config from themeConfig instead of navbar.

According to the current theme validation config (lack of required/default value), navbar can be null. Can you test whether or not it is possible to run a docusaurus site (on master) with navbar = null in config? If the site fails, we can safely add a `required()` to the Joi schema here and prevent this mistake, but if it works, we should maybe account for this and ensure that we don't destructure navbar before a null check.  Config errors should all be thrown ahead of time with validation system. 


Also, I think it's worth creating a ""useClassicThemeConfig"" hook to simplify a bit the code. Can you add it and type it with `any` returntype for now? We'll figure out to type it better after and how to keep it in sync with the Joi schema in another PR (you can put a `// TODO improve typing`)","2020-09-10T15:08:58Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

However, can you make an implementation where detecting the bad routes is decorrelated from the effect (logging/throwing). 

This way you can make the code more testable, and you'd be able to add tests easily on the most important parts.

Can you rework this PR, keeping the same behavior for now, and making the effect configurable with a `onDuplicatePaths` setting or something?

You can get inspiration from here, as the broken links detection behavior is quite similar to this

Also, one awesome thing is that we can avoid bad image paths at compilation time now.

I also wonder, what do you think of supporting both syntaxes?

```
![](./assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png)
![](assets/docusaurus-asset-example-banner.png)
```

Also, what about supporting this for assets of the static folder too? 

For example we could make this work:

```
![](/img/docusaurus.png)
```

And make this fail at compile time:

```
![](/img/docusaurusTypo.png)
```

That would be a nice feature and add more safety to the assets system","2020-07-20T11:14:29Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Hey, that's really great work, I'm impressed that we are able to migrate D1 website as easily in an automated way, except a few parts. 

The versioning algorithm seems to work nicely.

I've left some comments here and there for details. 

Here are some more important things to discuss:

## Git history


The current strategy is to migrate from v1 website to v2 website, by copying most files to another folder.

I think it's important for v1 sites to not lose their git history, and being able to inspect the diff between v1 and v2 more easily than just seeing an enormous diff.

For these reasons, I think it would be better to migrate a v1 site in its current location, and have files preserve their history as much as we can. Possibly, using `git cp` and `git mv` commands instead of fs.writeFile etc.

I tried the following, and it didn't work great  :p 

`yarn docusaurus-migrate migrate website-1.x website-1.x`

For tests, you could just copy ./website-1.x to /tmp/random, and migrate the site here directly

This may be a lot of work, please give a try, and tell me if you think it's possible to do something about git history, or if it would be overkill 

## Steps and logs

One important thing to consider, is that we likely have errors in this migration cli. It's hard to plan for every weird thing the users would have on their v1 sites.

The current cli executes the migrations step by step. The major problem with this approach is that if the 1st step fails for any random reason, the user is blocked and unable to run the other steps in an automated way. 

I think it's worth considering the worst case scenario and enable the user to run each step independently. By default we could run all steps one by one, and if some step fails, maybe just log the error and continue to next step?

It's worth considering if order of steps matter.

Also, that would be nice to have logs of what is happening exactly. Maybe have a std status at the end of each step, like ""success/failed/skipped"" or something?

The current output is not very verbose about what's happening exactly.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86946634-f75c8d80-c14a-11ea-90a2-687c237ca547.png)


## Migrate the pages

That would be cool if we could automate this part a little bit.

It's possible to use JSCodeShift and codemods to transform automatically commonJS to ESM modules, or stateless classes to SFCs...

I've built a tool to ""modernize"" a react file a few years ago, that was basically running jscodeshift + eslint --fix + prettier (not maintained, but could serve as inspiration): https://github.com/slorber/react-reboot/blob/980bf2fc05eb310f5bfc7d530cd48659b7dc098f/src/lib/react-reboot.js


For the component library, as there are only 3 comps, we could inline those comps directly in page:

```
const CompLibrary = require('../../core/CompLibrary.js');

const MarkdownBlock = CompLibrary.MarkdownBlock; /* Used to read markdown */
const Container = CompLibrary.Container;
const GridBlock = CompLibrary.GridBlock;
```

could become:

```
// TODO migrate those v1 components
const MarkdownBlock = (props) => <div {...props}/>
const Container = (props) => <div {...props}/>
const GridBlock = (props) => <div {...props}/>
```

Also, we could migrate:

```
module.exports = Users;
```

to 

```
export default function UsersPage(props) {
  return (
     <Layout title=""your page title"">
       <Users {...props}/>
     </Layout>
   )
};
```

Also, migrate `<translate>` to `<Translate>` and provide a no-op impl like for comp library

That's worth checking some existing sites to see their pages and if this can be automated without being too complicated (probably we don't want to do AST manipulations).

Sites like Prettier are doing annoying things like `const siteConfig = require(process.cwd() + ""/siteConfig.js"");`


It is really a best effort, if this fails, it's not a big deal, the user will have errors in his terminal, or in the browser anyway...

There are probably things to improve for pages and mdx but I think we can safely merge and release this. Will open another issue for improvement ideas I have.


I'd like a few minor changes before merging this, that are not related to pages and mdx. Those things are annoying details that we can see while running `yarn docusaurus-migrate migrate ./website-1.x ./test-migrated`


### /docs folder copied

We should migrate the docs in place, preserve their history, and allow user to inspect their diff to see where the migration tool might fail (he might need to fix migration errors later if he don't notice them at first).

It's not a big deal if /docs folder stays outside of the docusaurus project, user will be able to move it easily inside if needed, using ""git mv"" to preserve his history if he cares about it.

For the rest of the site I think it's less important to preserve the history anyway.

Note: I only talk about the docs folder, not the versioned docs, for which it's less important to me to preserve the history as it's copied on each release anyway (and it would be difficult to achieve)

### customFields

the theme-related attributes all end up in this part of the config, they should rather be filtered

### update branch

Can't merge for now :)

Hence we need to introduce ways to make it more robust, possibly via namespacing. It'd be horrible if plugins overwrote each other's global data due to colliding keys.

I mentioned before that we want to allow multiple docs plugins in a website but the current versioning approach is global, which makes it impossible to do so. We should avoid the same mistake with global data.","2020-07-06T12:06:54Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"lex111","CONTRIBUTOR","Honestly, this current solution does not bear any benefit. As I understand it, we need to _clearly inform_ the docs user that they is looking at outdated information, _and also encourage_ they to use the latest version.

The link in ""breadcrumbs"" is almost invisible (and especially in dark mode looks ugly, IMO). 

I think we should add something like that alert:

This way we inform the user _clearly enough_:
- that they is viewing docs for an outdated version
- we ""urge"" they to switch to the latest version of docs, thus prompting they to upgrade their website to the newest version of Docusaurus

@slorber alright, thank you for carrying that forward to its meaningful conclusion!

However, I noticed some bugs:

- ""Nested"" docs (with slashes/dirs) no longer work if you define it in `homePageId` (e.g. `doc_cat/intro`). You can look at an example on Chart.js https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/sidebars.js#L8

- When in docs-only mode enabled (set to `routeBasePath: '/'`) and `homePageId` set with any value (eg `introduction`), all docs routes display content for specified `homePageId`, and _without_ a layout website:

"lex111","CONTRIBUTOR","First of all, I wanted to point out that this is a greatest improvement, I really like it, we will definitely include it in the upcoming Docusaurus release! But before that, we need to work on something to achieve an even better result.

1. New search box in navbar _catches the eye_ -- it stands out from all other UI elements of navbar. We don't need to focus on this particular element that way.

![screenshot_15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247234-e9126d80-a1ab-11ea-868d-eb71c11a3253.png)

I would make the background not so dark, rather the background from the current implementation is more suitable. In addition, I think it is necessary to reduce its height by analogy the current search input.

![screenshot_14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247247-ec0d5e00-a1ab-11ea-85d7-22a62f0c804e.png)
 
BTW keyboard elements doesn‚Äôt look well on my Linux computer, eg, the text of ‚ÄúCTRL‚Äù is poorly read (see first screnshoot above).

Therefore, other keyboard elements in SVG look much clearer than if they are stylized using CSS. Maybe it makes sense to switch to use SVG icons in the search box too?

![screenshot_19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247204-de57d880-a1ab-11ea-8a20-ea04fb589384.png)

In addition, in the dark mode, I believe that we also need to adopt the background from the current search.

| New   | Old    |

The shadow of the keyboard icons is pretty visible, maybe it reduce it?

2. On small screens (eg iPhone 5), we see that the search navbar is positioned incorrectly. Earlier, in the previous release we did only display the search icon on mobiles, you can look at https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/2791 for more details.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83249167-d64d6800-a1ae-11ea-965a-404416afca45.png)

In this implementation search, I think we need to do the same. (Although in my opinion it looks worse than in the current version. Maybe the search in oval form looks better than a round one. Or the new magnifier icon is not very strong -- I'm not sure).

| Issue on small mobiles   | Proposed solution    |
| -------- | -------- |
| ![screenshot_12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247273-f3346c00-a1ab-11ea-80dc-8ab87ee298c2.png) | ![screenshot_13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4408379/83247264-efa0e500-a1ab-11ea-81f5-dd242177db89.png) |


3. Instead of a hard-coded magenta color, is it better for us to use the [primary color website](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/master/website/src/css/custom.css#L9) to style a new search?

| Current behavior   | Proposed solution based on a website styling (by example of Docusaurus)   |

4. Minor bugs:

- The vertical scroll bar is displayed even if there is no scrollable content. Can we show it only when it is really needed?

"slorber","COLLABORATOR","Hi @francoischalifour,

I tested the feature and it seems to work fine.
Thanks for adding the / shortcut, that will be helpful, and both shortcuts seems common.


There are a few things I'd like to get discussed or changed before merging this PR:

## base Url

Search links do not work for sites with a baseURL

## localstorage mandatory ?

@krillboi has expressed the need to avoid using local storage: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/2815#issuecomment-641838973

Do we have an option that permits this? What should we say to users that want no local storage usage?

## theme

Old

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86924018-2a912380-c12f-11ea-84a2-f3ae5997dd7d.png)

New

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86924044-354bb880-c12f-11ea-9a6e-bd0c1e65b2d4.png)

The new input should reuse more of our css vars, and look like before to be better integrated. 

At least the background of the search input should be the same as the background of the dark mode toggle, exactly like you have on your own DocSearch site:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/86924210-717f1900-c12f-11ea-8f8e-03eb3695a03e.png)

The modal colors also don't really match our existing theme (but we could handle that in another PR)

## theme validation

There is a new system to validate/normalize theme options, using a Joi schema. It's not necessary to emit warnings in components if we are sure that options are valid.

Would you like to work on proper validation system for Algolia options?

We could handle that in another PR, as this new validation system is optional, and we have contributors in this repo willing to help and familiar with the new validation system. 

But you probably know more about how to validate DocSearch v3 options in a robust way, so let me know.

---

Again, thanks for your work, my focus is to get this merged asap, as it seems a great improvement.

I think the PR can be merged as is, and we can handle the improvement work internally if you prefer, let me know.

For users that want to stay on v2, I think we should encourage the community to maintain its own v2 plugin: they could bootstrap it from latest v2 code from this repo (alpha.58 release is likely the last v2).

The main repo will try to always be up to date with DocSearch version. The community would archive/maintain older versions.","2020-07-08T13:39:11Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"lex111","CONTRIBUTOR","Yes, I get this, I meant that adding custom redirects, as described in #2843, is pretty verbose.

```js
  createRedirects: function (existingPath) {
    if (existingPath === '/docs/newDocPath') {
      return ['/docs/oldDocPathFrom2019', '/docs/legacyDocPathFrom2016'];
    }
    if (existingPath === '/docs/newDocPath') {
      return ['/docs/oldDocPathFrom2019', '/docs/legacyDocPathFrom2016'];

    if (existingPath === '/docs/newDocPath') {
      return ['/docs/oldDocPathFrom2019', '/docs/legacyDocPathFrom2016'];

function Footer(): JSX.Element | null {

export default Footer;

It worked great apart the theme original import

Just adding the type make it work better:

```
declare module '@theme/*';
declare module '@theme-original/*'; // => missing
```

We should also document this because the local TS setup is not so obvious. Didn't know about the /// directives before such as

- Not many people add announcement bar
- This only happens for people with a lot of docs *and* they have enough items open such that the page exceeds the viewport height

It's not like it's a very serious bug, the docs sidebar is still very usable.

The amount of code and complexity added to make this work far exceeds the benefit this fix brings :( ","2020-05-22T10:22:27Z",false,"COMMENTED"

Instead of allowing for a specifying a template string and doing variable replacement, it'd be better to just allow specifying the `metaTitle` as a prop and allow users to overwrite it. There can be endless combinations of meta titles that users want, we might as well let users have full control over it.

Few ways we can move forward:
- Recommended - Shift nprogress out of Docusaurus core and implement using plugins like what [VuePress does](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/official/plugin-nprogress.html#vuepress-plugin-nprogress) and add the plugin to `@docusaurus/theme-classic`

It's a legacy feature in v1 to create a route for every Markdown file in the `docs` directory and if we allow imports from one level higher as well, it may include unintended files.

EDIT: To prevent conflicts, I'll merge this first. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

- Renamed package names to `@docusaurus/` scope to leverage on monorepo capabilities
- Removed blog plugin for now as we haven't implemented the theme components. 
- Added the page plugin instead so that we can start the bootstrap template and see something
- Removed the (currently) unused stuff from the template (docs and blog markup)

Bootstrap template now which only has the index page. Note that the `src/pages/index.js` also needs to be updated with Bootstrap classes, but that can be done later.

"yangshun","CONTRIBUTOR","This is so awesome! I really like that you made it generic! Thank you @SamChou19815! 

What do you think about adding a new prop to `<Tabs />` called `groupKey`? The presence of this prop means that that all the `Tabs` instance of this `groupKey` wants to be grouped and updated together. With such a `groupKey`, a few problems with the current approach is solved:

- The current choices data structure doesn't know which Tabs it originally belongs to and there might be collisions with new Tabs of different purpose but have the same value (chances are slim but you never know).
- Allows saving each individual choice in its own localStorage key instead of stringifying the entire choices object (e.g. `docusaurus.tabs.operating_system`, `docusaurus.tabs.package_manager`). Also eliminates the possibility of a corrupted value for one groupKey affecting the other groupKeys.

Lemme know your thoughts!

EDIT: Just read the comments above and realized my suggested approach was exactly what you did. @lex111 I believe using a `groupId`/`groupKey` is better for engineering stability and maintainability even if it requires more work from the user. Docusaurus tries to be explicit and avoid magic behind the scenes. Apologies for the conflicting opinions!","2020-03-11T15:02:32Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

to any page and try to build it. It will fail.

But if you do this:

```js
<BrowserOnly>{() => window.location.pathname}</BrowserOnly>

along with the suggested change of doing `children()` within `BrowserOnly.js`, it will be fine.

I've left some initial review comments.

I'm not very familiar with PWA yet, but will review it a bit deeper soon and test it.

As it's opt-in (not in classic preset), I guess we should try to merge this soon, and let users provide us feedback, so that we can improve incrementally.

Do we have all the possible routes on the client side? If we do we can know which paths are not part of the app and then fallback to full page navigation.

Just a nit - on the upper left hand side of the screenshot there's a ""logo"" tooltip (probably your cursor was hovering over the logo). Could you take another screenshot? Or we could just use this.

Tip - I used Chrome's [built-in screenshot utility](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/08/devtools-release-notes#screenshot-areas) to take many of the screenshots you see in the showcase, you might find it more helpful than the OS screenshoting approach.","2019-11-24T01:46:33Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

- Infima is a CSS framework and is meant for the base CSS styles which is view library-agnostic. We want it to be usable with Vue and Angular as well.
- We want to come up with `react-infima` which provides Infima-styled React components, and Docusaurus should use them in future instead of writing so many of its own React components like we do now.
- This `Tabs` component was meant to be a temporary thing for minimal v1 compatibility. It should really be imported from `import Tabs from 'react-infima'` in future. I planned to use https://ui.reach.tech/tabs/ and then add Infima classnames to it.

Before I review this PR in-depth, I'd like to get your opinions on what you think about using Reach UI for accessible-ready components so that we don't have to implement the functionality of so many of our own components and can just focus on the appearance.","2019-11-17T12:11:38Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"yangshun","CONTRIBUTOR","I finally got the chance to take a good look at this. I apologize for the following:

- For taking so long to get back to you. Work has been really hectic and I'm busy getting my last minute #impacc for the half.
- My earlier comment that theme would automatically update was incorrect. `useTheme` would not sync state across components - I completely forgot that `useTheme` uses `useState`, and component state is local. I found out that by doing `useTheme` in so many components in our code, we were initializing theme state around 7 times on certain pages (once for each codeblock). That's completely unnecessary and unintended. The proper way was for theme to be part of context. Heck, even the React context examples used theme as their example.

I'm not in favor of the event bus as a communication mechanism because the theme value is clearly part of state and we should use an idiomatic React approach.

I considered a few approaches, including listening to the `window.localStorage` changes and syncing the theme state across components, but the `window.addEventListener('storage', ...)` API doesn't allow listening for events on the same page. Hence I settled on creating a theme context that can be used by every component which needs the theme. 

The good:
- Individual components now have control over the theme and can set the theme and update all places which are relying on that theme context/state.
- No duplicated theme state across components. It's all the way at the top of the component tree in the theme context provider

The bad:
- I had to inject the theme provider in `<Layout/>`. People who swizzled layout will not get the updates or their code might even break. Thankfully it's just a one-line change on their part and they can easily move to this theme context approach.
- Users who create their own layout need to explicitly use the theme provider as well for theming functionality, whereas the event bus approach doesn't have to, as there is no central state (distributed across the components which use it).

I'm unable to push to your PR branch, so I made a new one on this repo and the changes can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/commit/f708ed849b3f54adfd2c14ab8e7b4f4545040a8e). Let me know your thoughts!","2019-12-21T08:00:47Z",false,"COMMENTED"

- Lint is failing.
- Please don't delete our PR template. We wanna understand the motivations behind your PR.
- We wanna avoid dynamic classnames and only use static classnames. In future we might want to do some dead CSS elimination and static class names will be required. Here's a related article - http://jamie-wong.com/2013/07/12/grep-test/, which in a nutshell just means it's hard to statically analyze dynamically created strings. If we're really keen, we can enumerate the possible themes and generate the appropriate classname.
- Why do you need this class at all? Can you use `.html[data-theme=""dark""] .navbar`?","2019-11-17T11:31:04Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

Some suggestions I have:

- Create a custom hook so that this is reusable by non-theme classic Docs components. In future if we want to have a Bootstrap theme, we can reuse this hook.
  - The hook should take in the corresponding class names as function arguments.
  - `DocItem` should import this hook and invoke it with the classnames specific to this theme.
- You might want to take a look at the implementation of https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1524 for inspiration on how this was achieved in v1. v1's behavior is great and battle-tested (no complaints about it so far). cc @tusharf5 if he's interested in helping to review.","2019-10-27T20:49:21Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

- Can we generate an `id` value for the `<h1>` based on the title? Doesn't seem right to use the same hardcoded id for the title on all pages
- Why not target the specific class added to the doc header and add similar position offset CSS like we did for the page's h2 and h3? If the class doesn't exist, we could add one.

With the above, the issue should be fixed in both v1 and v2 right?

On subsequent version, it creates versioned docs if and only if the docs content are different. In cases where only one doc content is different, the relative resolving wont work.

Also, we can allow a simpler format for the most common use cases. If a 2nd index is present and it's an array, that item is a category and the values in the 2nd array are children of that category. This definitely makes us have more work to do but is less verbose and resembles the plugins/preset config. WDYT?

```js
module.exports = {
  docs: [
    [
      'item', [
        'inner-foo',
        'inner-bar',

-  - `headerLinks` doc, page, blog is deprecated and has been to moved into `themeConfig` under the name `navbar`. The syntax is now:

```js
themeConfig: {
  navbar: {

    logo: {

A few alternatives I can think of:

- Is there a way to set it for this execution of the command only?
- Hacky solution - save the current git config, set it before the execution, execute deploy, set it back to the original. Have to handle the case where the deploy fails and we have to set the config back to the original.

"yangshun","CONTRIBUTOR","Thanks for the PR! Unfortunately we are not too keen on accepting new features in v1 at the moment:

- We don't want to further increase the feature parity gap between v1 and v2
- It doesn't seem like a common useful feature to have a different color for the in-development version
- What happens if we don't define the `currentVersionXXX` colors in the config? Many existing users would not have defined them

To save yourself time in future, you could file an issue for a feature request and we can discuss it before you start to implement it. It's a pity because we would not be able to merge great PRs which aren't going in the direction we want to take it and your effort could be better channeled elsewhere if we had discussed prior to the PR.

Do let us know your thoughts!","2019-07-31T08:43:58Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"yangshun","CONTRIBUTOR","Hmm I'm not so sure whether it's a good idea to change the order now. But if we were to change it, we should do it asap. There's also value in doing it in a similar fashion as Gatsby: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/starters/

Alternatively, make some of the parameters into options so that the order wouldn't matter, we can default the template to our classic template.

Will defer to @endiliey to make the call.","2019-07-29T02:03:59Z",false,"COMMENTED"
"endiliey","CONTRIBUTOR","actually tbh i feel there isnt a lot of benefit of changing the order now.

in fact: it broke the order for previous version (some people can just remove the @next and later find that the order is different for previous version

and also if both options are not passed, we still prompt for name first and then template.

im thinking to maybe lets just revamp the init once and for all

simplify it to

npx @docusaurus/init then interactively prompt ?? or default the name and template to website and classic

thoughts ?","2019-07-29T06:39:49Z",false,"COMMENTED"
