A couple of thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Having the warning at the `import dask.dataframe as dd` level seems a little heavy handed. IIRC we only use `pyarrow` in a few place (i.e. Parquet / ORC / `engine=\"pyarrow\"` in `read_csv` and auto-inferring pyarrow strings). Can we just emit this warning in those cases? \r\n- Does adding `pyarrow-hotfix` as a core `dask` dependency have any downside? It's a small, pure Python package with no dependencies (not even `pyarrow`). That would ensure that no matter what, if you're using a new version of Dask, you're not impacted by the issue.  \r\n\r\nAlso cc @rjzamora for visibility ","submittedAt":"2023-11-10T03:07:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"fjetter"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-11-08T16:16:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"fjetter"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-11-09T09:10:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"phofl"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-11-20T11:31:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the fix @charlesbluca !

When neither `npartitions` nor `partition_size` is specified, we should calculate a default `npartitions` value that monotonically increases with respect to `len(seq)`.\r\n\r\nFor example, I believe the following code (while a bit rough) will satisfy both of these criteria:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    remainder = 0\r\n    seq = list(seq)\r\n    seq_len = len(seq)\r\n    if partition_size is None:\r\n\r\n        if npartitions is None:\r\n            if seq_len <= 100:\r\n                npartitions = seq_len\r\n            else:\r\n                npartitions = math.floor(100.0 * math.sqrt(seq_len/ 100.0))\r\n            npartitions = max(1, npartitions)\r\n        \r\n        partition_size = int(math.floor(seq_len / npartitions))\r\n        remainder = seq_len % npartitions\r\n\r\n    if remainder:\r\n        start_size = partition_size + 1\r\n        start_count = start_size * remainder\r\n        parts = list(partition_all(start_size, seq[:start_count])) + list(partition_all(partition_size, seq[start_count:]))\r\n    else:\r\n        parts = list(partition_all(partition_size, seq))\r\n```","submittedAt":"2023-05-23T21:19:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jrbourbeau"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @rjzamora.

Usually if someone needs to use the `main` branch of `dask`, installing from source with `pip install git+https://github.com/dask/dask` works. My reading of the discussion in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/10167 is that RAPIDS would find this slightly useful. My preference would be to hold off on this until more people ask for it, or go out and find more use cases there a nightly wheel would provide some positive impact. My concern is that this would only be useful to a small number of people and not really worth the associated maintenance cost. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't block us from publishing a nightly wheel, but would ask that someone (my guess is you?) commit to maintaining whatever infrastructure is added. Similar to what you're already doing for the nightly conda package (thank you for that). I'd also prefer hosting a nightly wheel alongside the nightly conda package in https://anaconda.org/dask (option 2 here https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/10167#issuecomment-1502667121). I've seen folks (myself included) use the release history on PyPI and wouldn't want to see it consist mostly of nightly releases. \r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to include any extra context I may be missing.

Here we have dealt with exactly one: anonymous access.\r\n\r\nThis seems okay to me. `anon`/`anonymous` seems somehow special as it's very commonly used -- I think special casing that one keyword is reasonable. Other than that, `s3fs.S3FileSystem` and `pyarrow.S3FileSystem` share no arguments, and since we handle falling back to `s3fs` gracefully, any existing code that specifies `s3fs`-specific storage options will continue to use `s3fs.S3FileSystem`.

Honestly, I don't think we should offer this functionality at all. Row groups are more or less random chunks with statistics to optimize data access. Why would we want to guarantee a one-to-one mapping to dask partitions?\r\nEven if that is a use case, how frequent is it really? Is this edge case really worth the complexity?\r\n\r\n> Are we okay with chunksize corresponding to an uncompressed storage size, or do we want to use the real in-memory size? Although I was originally planning for in-memory size, I eventually decided on using a value that is available in the parquet metadata (for performance reasons).\r\n\r\nI don't see a problem with this as long as it is clearly documented. I'd love some utility functions that could tell the user what the average compression ratio for a given dataset is (even if it is just sampled) to help advanced users make good decisions.\r\nIn my experience, compressed vs uncompressed is maybe a factor of 2-3 *unless* the user really knows what they are doing and write a dataset highly compressed (I've seen parquet files with 20-100 compression ratios but this is very rare and this kind of expert user can use the API appropriately).\r\n\r\n\r\n> What should the default chuksize be when split_row_groups=\"auto\"? This PR proposes the same as the default blocksize used in read_csv (1/10 the per-core memory).\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see the 1/10 implementation. This will break down for all kinds of distributed compute scenarios. Even for a LocalCluster this might be a bit much.\r\n\r\nOne datapoint: I have a 16GB / 4 CPU notebook. That would create 400MB uncompressed data partitions. That will easily blow up to a GB or more after decompression. That's a bit heavy.\r\nThis will, of course, be caught by `min(blocksize, int(64e6))`, i.e. I realistically have `64MB * compression ratio` almost all the time unless somebody has *many* CPUs with virtually no memory\r\n\r\nSo, two things\r\n\r\n1. I think the logic we're applying here is overkill. psutil + rounding down to 64MB sounds smart but in the end it's hard coded 64MB, why not be explicit? Even if it's not rounded, the psutil will lead to confusing results when executing on a distributed cluster. After all, why would the client memory size have an impact on worker memory size? Lastly, the *truly optimal* chunksize should consider cluster size as well... After this argument, why not drop the \"auto\" calculation and just set \"64/100MiB\" as a default? In my experience this is a better UX than some magical/opaque \"auto\"\r\n2. 64MB uncompressed feels OK. That'll create 100-500MB uncompressed partitions which I think is a comfortable place for a default value","submittedAt":"2022-11-29T10:00:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-02-14T19:34:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"martindurant"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2023-02-17T21:01:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"phobson"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for catching this!","submittedAt":"2022-11-08T15:35:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"jrbourbeau"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @qheuristics -- this is in \r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed this is your first code contribution to this repository.

Is that correct, or am I missing something? Since things are now working on conda-forge, I'm wondering how much this change is needed. \r\n\r\nTo be clear, I don't have a strong objections to adding `click` -- it's a small, popular, pure Python library. I also suspect many (most?) Dask users today already install `click` because `pip install dask[complete]` and `conda install dask` pull in `click`. I'm just trying to get a better understanding for what problem gets solved by adding `click` as a dependency. \r\n\r\ncc @jacobtomlinson as I believe he had some reservations around making `click` a required dependency (xref https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9283#issuecomment-1193806208) ","submittedAt":"2022-10-26T20:35:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jakirkham"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-10-27T16:46:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jakirkham"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Should we bump the `click` requirement to 7.0 in `setup.py` & `meta.yaml` too?","submittedAt":"2022-10-27T21:19:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jrbourbeau"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> I'm just trying to get a better understanding for what problem gets solved by adding click as a dependency.\r\n\r\nCircling back to this point, one thing I'd like to do is update our issue template to use `dask info versions` instead of asking separately for `dask`, `distributed`, and `python` versions as running `dask info versions` is less of an ask for users. Having `click` installed already will reduce barriers for this. I'll admit I only see this as moderate motivation for adding `click` as a dependency, but I also think that's probably okay in this case.\r\n\r\nI'll propose we give a bit more time for others to weigh in (@jakirkham asked for feedback here https://github.com/dask/community/issues/283#issuecomment-1291137925 a few days ago) and then merge prior to releasing today.

(When @pavithraes ran the reproducer, she saw a huge amount of garbage collection warnings). And it must be related to serialization, since no such behavior happens for a single-machine scheduler:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport distributed\r\nimport dask\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nvalues = list(np.random.randint(2**30, size=1_000_000))\r\n\r\nstart = time.time()\r\ndask.delayed(values, traverse=False).compute(scheduler=\"threads\")\r\nend = time.time()\r\nprint(end-start)  # 0.01 seconds\r\n```\r\nBut with a distributed scheduler:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport distributed\r\nimport dask\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ncluster = distributed.LocalCluster()\r\nclient = distributed.Client(cluster)\r\n\r\nvalues = [1] * 1_000_000\r\n\r\nstart = time.time()\r\ndask.delayed(values, traverse=False).compute()\r\nend = time.time()\r\nprint(end-start)  # 37 seconds!\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this isn't *just* due to `pickle.dumps` of the python objects. Serializing them directly with `pickle.dumps` just takes a fraction of a second:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npickle.dumps(values)  # 0.026 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm fairly certain that we are hitting https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/6368 . In particular, the serialization framework isn't just serializing the list of values, but traversing that list (unnecessarily, IMO), and serializing *each value* independently. And if my list has things like `np.int64` objects in it instead of native python `int`s, things get slower by another factor of ~2!\r\n\r\nSo I think something along these lines is a good fix, but I also think that we might want to take a closer look at the serialization logic to see what is going so wrong.","submittedAt":"2022-08-23T22:26:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ian-r-rose"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks @hayesgb, I think this looks like it's ready.

I'm a bit uncomfortable with the function mutating its inputs. This basically performs as expected for the case where we bail out when no embedded collections are found. But I'm finding things to be off when I try to actually have some embedded collections to traverse. So, let's say I have something like the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, replace\r\nimport dask\r\nimport time\r\nimport random\r\n\r\n@dask.delayed\r\ndef op1(x):\r\n    time.sleep(random.uniform(0,1))\r\n    return replace(x, id=x.id+1, name = x.name + x.name)\r\n\r\n@dask.delayed\r\ndef op2(x):\r\n    time.sleep(random.uniform(0,1))\r\n    return replace(x, id=x.id*3, name=x.name.title())\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    id: int\r\n    name: str\r\n    \r\nx = MyClass(id=dask.delayed(1), name=dask.delayed(\"me\"))\r\n\r\nresults = dask.compute([op1(x), op2(x)], scheduler=\"threads\")\r\n\r\nprint(results)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn `main`, this works, and results in `([MyClass(id=2, name='meme'), MyClass(id=3, name='Me')],)`\r\n\r\n~~On this branch, it errors, as something seems to be off with the mutation logic:~~\r\n~~I think the above error could likely be fixed, but even then, I would expect the above example to race due to the mutation.~~\r\n\r\n(Edit, the original traceback was due to a typo in my example. I've fixed it, and it still behaves incorrectly, though the traceback is no longer relevant)\r\n\r\nSo I think that I would still prefer to go a route the (1) didn't mutate the inputs, and (2) allowed for frozen dataclasses (I think my original suggestion is one possible route). The cost, of course, is that we couldn't support dataclasses with custom inits that have embedded collections. But that is extremely niche, so I think I could live with it, especially if we could provide a useful error.","submittedAt":"2022-08-05T18:38:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"hendrikmakait"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-08-08T08:57:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ian-r-rose"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks @hendrikmakait!

I'm still digesting this, and haven't really looked much at the compatibility layer or visitor pattern, so my comments/questions are mostly around the API for operations.\r\n\r\nThings I like:\r\n1. Having an operation know about it's own dependencies seems like a huge improvement to me.\r\n2. Having an operation know about `divisions`, `npartitions`, etc also seems like a good choice. I wonder if we might also add a `collection_type` that could be `DataFrame`, `Series`, or `Scalar`. That might be too leaky of an abstraction, but I also see that it's somewhat fiddly to reason about what the \"output\" type of an operation currently is.\r\n3. I'm a bit sad to see the `Mapping` interface go, but overall this does look simpler than the status quo.\r\n4. It's fewer lines of code than I expected!\r\n\r\nMy main concern is around writing down some sort of contract for how these operations work. I'm curious if you think it would be helpful to (1) enforce some sort of immutability on `Operations` to force \"replays\" of things to always go through `regenerate()`, and (2) write down a semi-strict `Protocol` for the interface. I always like operating under some constraints like those, and find it really helpful when both implementing and designing interfaces.","submittedAt":"2022-05-17T23:41:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"wence-"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A few more minor comments/thoughts on read-through","submittedAt":"2022-05-18T10:16:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-05-18T15:27:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-05-18T15:30:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-05-18T15:30:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-05-18T15:32:38Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"dhirschfeld"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-05-19T01:02:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jsignell"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good to me!

I think it will definitely improve the user experience here and I like that the checks of the index are being combined into a single place for consistency. I do have a few specific concerns below and one high-level concern about `_check_index()`.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it seems like `_check_index()` is doing both the checking and the getting of the index, which seems like a bit of mixing of concerns in the same function. I personally find it confusing that `None` is a sentinel value to mean \"the index that's been passed is already the index\", especially because the other possible return value from `_check_index()` is the index that should be used.

I tried parameterizing your `test_fillna` over `group_keys=[True, False, None]`. Everything works on pandas `1.4.x`, but on `1.5.x`, `group_keys=True` presents a problem: in that case, the `apply` returns with extra multiindex columns for your grouped-by items.\r\n\r\nI think the fix should be fairly straightforward, however. For the case where `self.group_keys` is `True` in the `dd.GroupBy` object, we can do a final `map_partitions` to `df.droplevel(by)`. That is to say, we can easily drop the extra index columns at the end when `group_keys` is `True`.

I've marked a few places in your changes where the effect of the test has been removed (the test was to assert no warnings were raised), we'll want to fix those before merging.\r\n\r\nThere are other places where you added a specific warning class to `with pytest.warns` (e.g. `with pytest.warns(RuntimeError)`). Unless it's a case where we're testing that a specific warning is thrown, the usage of `with pytest.warns(None)` was to silence the warning message thrown (usually from a library dependency). Switching this to e.g. `pytest.warns(RuntimeError)`  changes the meaning of the test to testing that a specific warning is thrown, which will then fail if the library dependency changes their implementation. We'll want to revert these changes and use the following pattern instead:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Replace\r\nwith pytest.warns(None) as record:\r\n    ...\r\nassert not record\r\n\r\n# with this\r\nwith warnings.capture_warnings(record=True) as record:\r\n   ...\r\nassert not record\r\n\r\n# Replace\r\nwith pytest.warns(None):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n# with this\r\nwith warnings.capture_warnings(record=True):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis silences all warnings that would be shown in the block, and doesn't require an explicit filter applied.

I love a PR that has more deletions than additions. I'm still digesting this, but here are some early thoughts.\r\n\r\nMy biggest concern is around the interface of the base `Layer`. It now has some fairly strong assumptions about graph and partitioning structure (see, e.g., `output_blocks`, `_keys_to_indices`) which is not always true. An immediate consequence of this is that we need to allow `output_blocks` to be `None` everywhere to handle those cases. Right now that is mostly `MaterializedLayer`, but I could imagine other, weirder things involving `Delayed` layers or something. To me, this indicates that the `Layer` class is trying to do a bit too much.  I understand that part of what you are trying to do here is consolidate logic, so that impulse makes a lot of sense! But it feels a bit too far right now.\r\n\r\nI'm still thinking about this, and may have misunderstood something fundamental. But my instinct here is to actually have most of your `Layer` implementation be something like a `PartitionedLayer`, which handles a lot of logic around partitioned collections, output blocks, keys -> names -> indices -> keys translations, etc. And both that and `MaterializedLayer` could satisfy an abstract `Layer` interface that tries hard to be as close as possible to a pure `Mapping` interface + cull.","submittedAt":"2022-03-24T01:08:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-24T15:25:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-24T16:41:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-24T16:43:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-24T16:44:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ian-r-rose"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-24T18:25:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-25T15:00:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ian-r-rose"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-25T15:33:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"mrocklin"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-29T21:36:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"mrocklin"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-03-29T21:39:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-04-04T14:12:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jrbourbeau"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @djhoese ","submittedAt":"2022-02-07T20:26:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"charlesbluca"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-02-04T21:05:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jsignell"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-02-18T14:27:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"charlesbluca"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-02-18T15:12:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jsignell"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-02-18T15:29:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"charlesbluca"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2022-02-18T15:30:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jrbourbeau"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for taking this on @jsignell\r\n\r\n> Should the underlying directories be prefixed with test_?\r\n> I prefer no prefix unless others feel strongly.\r\n\r\nI have a similar preference.

I actually think that calling `len()` on HighLevelGraph Layers is not quite as safe as we would hope.\r\n\r\nWith the current design, `__len__()` gives the length of the *materialized* graph. But a lot of the time we don't actually know that length until it is materialized, as specific culling operations can dramatically change the length. So calling `__len__()` canl force materialization before we are ready.\r\n\r\nSee, e.g., the implementation for the `BroadcastJoinLayer`, which constructs the full task graph upon calling `__len__()`: \r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/4228dc7439f4ecd05708641bbe25adbf4d658f92/dask/layers.py#L919-L936\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing that *should* be safe to call is `get_output_keys()`, which is explicitly meant to not force materialization:\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/4228dc7439f4ecd05708641bbe25adbf4d658f92/dask/highlevelgraph.py#L94-L109\r\n\r\nThis has a slightly different meaning from the materialized graph length, in that it is restricted only to keys that might be of interest to other layers, rather than intermediate results or other private-ish tasks.\r\n\r\nSo I'd recommend tweaking the goal of this PR to either:\r\n\r\n1. Only show `__len__` if the graph is materialized.\r\n2. Show the length of `get_output_keys()` instead (and maybe change the label from `tasks (unoptimized)` to something like `number of outputs`.\r\n\r\nI'd probably prefer the second, as it's closer to the heart of what HighLevelGraphs are meant to do, which is reason about inputs/outputs without forcing a full graph construction.","submittedAt":"2022-01-21T20:23:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ian-r-rose"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"So sorry for the slow review @kori73!

Actually, the docs say that `kwargs` shouldn't contain dask arrays:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/f91179fedd591c6a0e01175c51ac0e32881ede53/dask/array/core.py#L521-L523\r\n\r\nFor several dask arrays passed as regular arguments `block_info` works though (e.g. `def func(arr, arr2, block_info=None):` and `out = da.map_blocks(func, arr, arr)` in your example).\r\n\r\nAs a general comment, I've noticed that the current `block_info` explanation is part of the `map_blocks` function examples (and not of the API doc).

If you're taking lots of slices out of an array, you could end up worst-case making a full copy of the array when you didn't have to.\r\n\r\nTo do this correctly in generality, we'd probably need to implement it as an optimization pass, rather than something built into getitem at runtime. We'd look at a chunk, and all of its immediate dependencies that are `getitems`, and sum up how many elements total are gotten from the chunk vs the size of the chunk. If that total is less that XX%, then we rewrite the `getitems` to do a copy, otherwise we leave them alone. Ideally this could be done as a high-level graph optimization as part of the slicing layer (cc @GenevieveBuckley @ian-r-rose)!\r\n\r\nBut since that's probably a bigger undertaking and this will solve some common-case problems right now, let's just think about how we can mitigate its bad behavior on these uncommon cases.\r\n\r\n1. Document this new behavior somewhere. Right now the current behavior is surprising and easy to shoot yourself in the foot with, but at least it matches NumPy's surprising and easy-to-shoot-yourself-in-the-foot-with behavior (which is [documented](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html#:~:text=NumPy%20slicing%20creates,copy()%20is%20recommended.), albeit obscurely). People expect us to follow NumPy, so where we're diverging we should note it.\r\n2. Provide users _some_ way to control it, if they were relying on the previous behavior.

If the `make_meta` dispatching was being performed in the way that [`concat` is used throughout Dask-Dataframe](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/ac1bd05cfd40207d68f6eb8603178d7ac0ded922/dask/dataframe/methods.py#L428), then there would be a \"middle-man\" function where we could add a kwarg like `parent_meta=`.  However, Dask-Dataframe is using the dispatch name directly (`make_meta`), and so you are effectively adding this \"middle-man\" function under the name `make_meta_util` (and using it throughout the code base).  Is this correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, then I think this solution makes sense -- At least, I cannot think of a better way to do it :)","submittedAt":"2021-05-18T18:41:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"pentschev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-05-18T19:01:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"galipremsagar"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-05-19T16:13:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"galipremsagar"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2021-05-19T16:14:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rjzamora"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks Prem!

For @jakirkham's [failing test](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7486#issuecomment-810516118) though, what do you think about the approach in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7399/commits/757927a3278bcba35e2969f2c79d28a67bd422c3 of having the final `concatenate` preserve ndarray subtypes? That basically solves the `recarray` and `memap` tests (memap with this small hack in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7399/commits/df24a87a8a3958d1e5b35729947aca7c7a11a4cf; debatable if that's a good idea).\r\n\r\nFor non-ndarray subclasses, we should already get similar type-preserving behavior from `__array_function__`, if the type implements it. (You could argue that `np.recarray` and `np.memap` are just poorly-behaved ndarray subclasses, since they don't implement `__array_function__`. But alas, we still have to deal with it.)\r\n\r\nI think in some cases, you might actually care that `ddf.to_records().compute()` doesn't return a `np.recarray` as you were expecting—for example, attribute access to fields would fail.

Can you verify that we have full test coverage on the new code?\r\n\r\n~Check out https://github.com/ryan-williams/dask/pull/2!~\r\n\r\n~The tests pass, but I'm a bit concerned about some apparent timeouts that are happening while cleaning up tests that simulated failures ([using the default `if_exists=fail` when the table already exists](https://github.com/ryan-williams/dask/pull/2/files#diff-6dd213d7000c7e672b94c2166a45e13fR405)).~\r\n\r\n~My thought was to debug/iterate/review over there and then merge it into this branch, but if we're mostly settled here now I can merge it in here and we can continue discussion here.~\r\n\r\nSorry, I misread your ask. I've added some basic tests for `parallel=True` now.\r\n\r\n`assert_eq` seems to handle comparing two DFs though the rows are out of order, so the `parallel=True` tests should pass regardless of what order the blocks get inserted in.\r\n\r\nI locally changed the test to have a 5-partition, 10-element version, and observed scrambled DFs to come back from SQL (similar to [my notebook example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/ryan-williams/0aeb2111cb8b7fd588784e2a7c35433e/dask.dataframe.to_sql%20example.ipynb#Check-the-DB-table-)), but the assertions still passed, so hopefully we're good there.\r\n\r\n------\r\n## Open Q's\r\n- are the timeouts in the distributed tests ok? https://github.com/ryan-williams/dask/pull/2 ([latest comment](https://github.com/ryan-williams/dask/pull/2#issuecomment-607610513))\r\n- is `pickle.dumps(result)` failing on a \"chained\" Dask object ok? https://github.com/ryan-williams/dask/pull/3\r\n\r\n## Open comment threads:\r\n- [`dd.DataFrame.to_sql` docstring](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6038/files#r401606634)\r\n- [eager vs. lazy `df.meta.to_sql`](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6038/files#r401610741)\r\n\r\n## Travis `tlz` import failure\r\nFinally, I still don't know why the `tlz` import is failing in `test_imports.sh`, but if that ends up being the last problem I'm sure we can fix it.\r\n\r\n**Update**: this passed in the latest Travis. I'm not sure why! Maybe upstream tests all passing helped it, or maybe something subtle about circular-import-deps between modules (I broke a `delayed.py`↔️`utils.py` cycle in one of the recent commits) was causing it.

In general this looks like a good PR.  It's nice to see you pick up Dask graphs so readily!

Scheduling-wise this becomes tricky, because Dask will have to compute the maximum value first, before computing any bincount computations.  Today's schedulers will evaluate each chunk, compute the maximum of that chunk, and then hold onto that chunk so that, after it computes the max-of-maxes, it can compute binchunk.  This means that we'll have the entire array in memory, which we usually try to avoid if possible.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, what if we just called `np.bincount` on all of the chunks without specifying a minlength value and only afterwards, once we had all of them together, would we make a new array of the correct length and then add all of them into that array?

I've left some detail-oriented comments in the review below, but let me first mention some high level things.\r\n\r\nThe constraint today that `map_blocks` expects at least one dask array is, indeed, a limitation and often yields complexity.  However, I hesitate to add a new abstraction to the codebase.  Using `from_block_function` as written in this PR does require the user to pick up and learn a new tool, which is slightly concerning.  This makes me curious about how we might align this work to existing APIs within dask.array with which users might already be familiar.  For example, rather than using a new `block_info` object, maybe this should use an extended version of the `block_info` dict already used in `map_blocks`.  Maybe there is some way to integrate this more tightly into the map_blocks API directly, rather than making a new function (though map_blocks is already quite dense).\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm curious why you needed this function originally.  Was this solving a problem for you in your work, or are you just trying to clean things up inside of dask array?\r\n\r\nThanks again for all the work.","submittedAt":"2019-04-14T15:09:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"TomAugspurger"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-02-08T20:24:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"TomAugspurger"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-02-08T20:48:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"mrocklin"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-02-06T00:00:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jcrist"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2019-03-04T18:48:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jrbourbeau"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This looks really nice @TomAugspurger, thanks for your work here.

for working on this @mrocklin! Excited to play with these changes.\r\n\r\nAdded a few comments above mainly how documentation/commenting might improve. Fair warning I'm still getting over a cold so some confusion is probably on my part alone. Feel free to use your discretion on what part you respond to/address.\r\n\r\nIndependently it's not clear to me whether this behavior should be called `auto` or whether it should get a more descriptive name and we add a few other options alongside. Think there are arguments both ways and would be good to hear your POV on this.\r\n\r\nAlso had some comments about how things like `limit` might be extended in this and/or future PRs. Would be good to hear your thoughts on this as well.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Happy to answer questions should any arise.

main issue with this is the use of a *global* configuration object. I have a slight preference for moving the global config state and functions into a class, and initing an instance of that class on load.

things like standard deviation - it would be easy to lose precision with the repeated addition result chunks. Biggus goes to some length to implement a streaming single pass standard deviation for both masked and un-masked data, but I don't have an example that justifies that implementation vs what has been done here.\r\n\r\nI'm really pleased to say that a cursory experimentation suggests that the accuracy is very good. My code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnp.random.seed(0)\r\nrand = np.random.randn(100000) ** 20\r\n\r\n# ~4% masked numbers\r\ndata = np.ma.masked_outside(rand, -2, 2)\r\n\r\nchunks = (rand.size // 500,)\r\nda_data = da.ma.masked_where(da.from_array(data.mask, chunks=chunks),\r\n                            da.from_array(rand, chunks=chunks))\r\n\r\nprint(biggus.std(data, ddof=2, axis=0).masked_array())\r\nprint(np.std(da_data, ddof=2).compute())\r\nprint(np.std(da_data.compute(), ddof=2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich gives:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0.28873287828340444\r\n0.288732878283\r\n0.288732878283\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also visualised the graph with 5 equal chunks:\r\n![mydask](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810663/27318908-97c3a152-5586-11e7-9864-708ac2484f4e.png)\r\n\r\nWhich, just like the biggus implementation has a (necessary) bottleneck at the ``sqrt``, but the preparation before that point parallelises well (just like it does with a ``dask.array``).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n### In summary\r\n\r\nThis is a really great implementation - I've pointed out a few usability issues, but in principle I believe the implementation is a viable option for entirely bridging the remaining functionality gap between biggus and dask. With some refinement of this implementation I'm 100% supportive of moving towards formally deprecating biggus in favour of dask (note: I'm a core biggus dev).   \r\n\r\n","submittedAt":"2017-06-20T06:15:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jcrist"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-07-18T22:13:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"mrocklin"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-07-19T21:07:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"jcrist"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-07-19T22:54:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"TomAugspurger"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-03T15:27:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jcrist"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Looks fine to me.","submittedAt":"2017-05-02T12:28:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"TomAugspurger"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T19:04:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"TomAugspurger"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T19:05:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"TomAugspurger"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T19:06:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"mrocklin"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T15:32:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"martindurant"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T15:37:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"mrocklin"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T15:41:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"wesm"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T20:33:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"martindurant"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T20:47:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"wesm"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T21:02:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"martindurant"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-08T14:10:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jcrist"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Besides the docstring fix, seems fine to me.","submittedAt":"2017-05-02T12:30:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"jcrist"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2017-05-01T22:01:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"mrocklin"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"There were a few blocks that appeared to be untested.

The intent of `nout` was to deal with functions that return multiple results - the use case of a function returning a 1-tuple didn't come up. As such, `nout=None` and `nout=1` were both interpreted to mean a function that returned a single result (and not a tuple). Changing it as you have here seems fine though. My one concern is that the keyword argument name may not make sense anymore in the `nout=1` case. Upon first glance, I'd say that both `foo2` and `foo3` have 1 output, but this PR changes the meaning to be the length of the single output.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@delayed(nout=2)\r\ndef foo1():\r\n    return result1, result2\r\n\r\n@delayed(nout=1)\r\ndef foo2(a):\r\n    return (result,)\r\n\r\n# explicitly setting nout=None to illustrate default\r\n@delayed(nout=None)\r\ndef foo3(a):\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Keep the keyword name the same, but clarify its meaning in the docstring.\r\n- Deprecate the old name, and rename it to something better. Ideas: `ntuple`, `output_length`.\r\n\r\nSlight preference for option 1, as I think the current name matches the most common use cases.\r\n\r\n> On continues thoughts, I might even think it could be useful to extend the behavior to `nout=0`.\r\n\r\nI don't see a use case for returning a 0-tuple, but also see no harm in adding it.

I think that a lot of this can be cleaned up if we build an object around all of the things we need to open a file and send that object down to the relevant functions.  Those functions will then always use the object as a context manager, which will open the file in the function.  I think that this is cleaner than sending nested lambdas.\n\nI'm not normally a big fan of making classes, but this might be such a situation.  Here is one approach.\n\n``` python\nclass Opener(object):\n    def __init__(self, open, mode, compression, ...):\n        self.open = open\n        self.mode = mode\n        self.compression = compression\n        ...\n        self.filename = None\n        self.file = None\n\n    def __call__(self, filename):\n        return DelayedFile(self, filename)\n\nclass DelayedFile(object):\n    def __init__(self, opener, filename):\n        self.opener = opener\n        self.filename = filename\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self.file = self.opener.open(self.filename,
