However, I don't really like the current PR's implementation, it relays heavily on reflection which may be incompatible with trimming/NativeAOT, and may add substantial cost to typed Dictionaries which may be unacceptable to some users.\r\n\r\nI have not looked at the changes to `packed_scene.cpp` at all, that's an area of Godot I'm not very familiar with so I don't think I can comment on it.","submittedAt":"2024-10-12T17:01:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"SaracenOne"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-10T22:38:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"SaracenOne"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"My previous feedback was mistaken since all CanvasItems have z_relative set on by default, so this should be fine to merge as is after all 👍 ","submittedAt":"2024-10-10T22:57:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"clayjohn"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T19:33:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"lyuma"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T17:09:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"fire"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T17:20:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"fire"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T17:21:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"fire"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T17:24:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lyuma"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T18:45:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"aaronfranke"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T19:28:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T18:10:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"adamscott"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T15:08:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T15:27:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"adamscott"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T15:48:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"adamscott"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T15:51:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"adamscott"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T16:02:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Repiteo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T19:33:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"adamscott"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T22:48:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Repiteo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-08T14:49:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Repiteo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I disagree with `FORCE_SEMICOLON` being added in this context (see https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97934#discussion_r1792030407), but I'm otherwise onboard with this!

I prefer this file-based approach as it ensures source files are never modified by Godot (which is a problem due to Windows file locking, or even file modification dates being changed without users expecting it).\r\n\r\nFor all my tests, I renamed `spedometer.gd` in the project root to something else (and also renamed the corresponding `spedometer.gd.uid` when renaming outside the editor).\r\n\r\nSome feedback:\r\n\r\n- Renaming a script while the editor is open works.\r\n- Renaming a script while the editor is closed works, but an error about the script not being findable on the filesystem is sometimes printed the next time you open the editor. It may be related to the FileSystem dock status; I can't get this to happen consistently. The project will run correctly with no changes required anyway. It also works if you run `--import` then run the project directly.\r\n\r\n- Renaming a script while the editor is closed breaks the running project if you run the project immediately afterwards (**Run** button in the project manager), without going through the editor beforehand. Run it from a terminal to see this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: Attempt to open script 'res://test2.gd' resulted in error 'File not found'.\r\n   at: (modules\\gdscript\\gdscript.cpp:1102)\r\nERROR: Failed loading resource: res://test2.gd.

This is quite complex to implement correctly so it'd be a topic for its own proposal.\r\n\r\nEither way, I consider this to be in a good state to be

While I really like the concept and the implementation itself looks fine to me, I was somewhat concerned that the overhead of this PR could result in a performance regression for scenes that were the theoretical worst case for batching (I think I briefly mentioned something along those lines to clay during the last rendering meeting).\r\n\r\nSo to kill some time during my train ride, I threw together a gdscript that would randomly populate the scene with various 2D objects based on a given seed. Using this very scientific testing approach, I compared a non debug build of this PR with a non debug build of the dev2 commit.\r\nWhile I got a decent FPS boost most of the time in a handful of cases the opposite was the case, in the worst case scenario I lost around a third of my FPS.\r\n\r\nI didn't have time to look deeper into it, but my guess right now is that either the cpu overhead and additional indirection step on the GPU have enough performance overhead that this PR performs poorly with scenes that are not suitable for batching. (right now my prime suspect is the CPU, but even the GPU looked a bit suspect with the limited tooling I had on my craptop)\r\n\r\nI suppose some of that is unavoidable and might not necessarily be a problem in a real use case (though I wonder what would happen when someone makes er.g. a platformer that uses a lot of Shape2Ds for the terrain), but I would like to hear someone else's opinion on this before I approve the PR.","submittedAt":"2024-10-04T17:11:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"clayjohn"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good to me now. \r\n\r\nFor posterity, this change is a performance optimization that significantly reduces the number of batches needed to render a scene. Fewer batches means fewer draw calls which generally means much  lower CPU cost. \r\n\r\nIn all normal cases we have found that this is a huge performance win. Especially in cases that were tricky to batch previously (i.e. alternating textures like you would get when you have text with shadows). \r\n\r\nPreviously, users had some responsibility to ensure that objects were grouped together in a way that would favour batching. In Godot 3.x, we had a code path that could reorder elements to improve batching. With this change, there are many more situations that can be batched without users having to think about batching. \r\n\r\nHowever, the worst-case scenario has become slower. The worst-case scenario is a scene with a high number of draw calls where the batching system can only manage one object per batch. This can happen if the scene rotates back and forth between two different draw commands. \r\n\r\nIn our testing example we draw 10000 Sprites and 10000 lines for a total of 20000 batches. This creates a CPU bottleneck. With this PR, performance is approximately 2X worse on my i7-1165G7 CPU. That situation is, of course not realistic, but we will still work on improving performance in a follow up PR. \r\n\r\nBecause all realistic situations are a vast improvement and this PR fixes a few outstanding bugs, I am happy to merge it and then nail down performance in a follow up PR","submittedAt":"2024-10-04T22:54:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":7}},{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-08T17:27:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"stuartcarnie"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The latest commit includes:\r\n\r\n* `CTZ32` and `CTZ64` APIs to count trailing zeros using compiler intrinsics, if available, and a software fallback otherwise\r\n* Added unit tests to test intrinsic and software fallback of `CTZ(32|64)` APIs\r\n* Extended `LRUCach` in `lru.h` to support a `constexpr` template argument specifying a `BeforeEvict` callback, so clients can perform additional cleanup if an element is evicted from the cache. 2D needs this to free the uniform set RID. \r\n","submittedAt":"2024-10-13T23:57:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AThousandShips Literally unusable how dare you make such a blunder","submittedAt":"2024-09-22T19:29:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"LAUGH","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"clayjohn"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Nice catch!","submittedAt":"2024-09-22T20:25:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This seems okay.

This is a great start 🙂 \r\n\r\nSome feedback:\r\n\r\n- I'd make the snapshot store the exact Godot version (including commit hash) that was used to generate it, so that you can compare it in diffs. Use something like this to generate the stored version string:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/c3e16cda00a9fbec4515142f4c59bc5134f1bfb0/editor/project_manager.cpp#L1463-L1467\r\n\r\n- The **Snapshot Overview** line shouldn't have an underline, as people can mistake it for a clickable link. Just use a bold font to indicate it's a heading.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4548ca6e-b339-4485-915c-be6508c30d4a)\r\n\r\n- I noticed timestamp files are named according to the UTC time, not local time. This is inconsistent with log file naming which always uses local time.\r\n\r\n- It might be a good idea to compress ObjectDB snapshot files as they can get quite large in projects with lots of objects. If I put a 3.2 MB snapshot in a ZIP, it's only 224 KB once compressed, which is a more than 10x compression ratio. FileAccess has compression methods available for this, along with the Compression singleton.\r\n\r\n- Whenever I save a snapshot, I see this in the terminal output (not the editor Output panel):\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarting to snapshot\r\nWARNING: Property not found: ProjectSettings\r\n     at: ProjectSettings::_get (core\\config\\project_settings.cpp:351)\r\nsnapshot length: 7089\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe unknown setting warning should be fixed, and I suggest moving the snapshot-related prints to `print_verbose()` so that they only appear in verbose mode.\r\n\r\n- I got a sporadic crash when clicking the **Filter objects** field in the ObjectDB debugger.

not sure that's the proper way to fix this problem. With the mutex lock move, that only changes the racing condition that causes the issue.\r\n\r\nDebugging a bit, the problem is in fact that the `current.from` property of the `playback` refers to an `AnimationData` that is invalid because it was removed just above in your script while calling `remove_animation`. In `AnimationPlayer::_play`, `c.current.from` is accessed and it crashes since `c.current.from` is invalid.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems that the AnimationPlayer does not manage the removal of current playing animation. If you add a `animation_player.stop()` in your script before the animation removal, the problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nI suggest adding a call to `_stop_internal` in `AnimationPlayer::_animation_removed` when the current animation is the one that is being removed and reverting the modifications in `string_name.cpp`.\r\n\r\nBe careful, I just found another problem in `AnimationPlayer::_animation_removed`, the following condition can never be true since `AnimationMixer::_animation_removed` removed it from the `animation_set`  couple lines before.

No need for precise aiming.

But I have a question about the core/editor part. Why is it implemented as `EditorInspectorPlugin` and not a new `PROPERTY_HINT_TOOL_BUTTON` handled in `editor_properties.cpp`? In my opinion, an explicit property hint is better than implicit handling of properties with `Callable` type and empty value. It would allow to document hint format properly, for example for dynamic addition of tool buttons via `_get_property_list()`.\r\n\r\nAlso, we could not limit tool buttons to GDScript, but add them to core, GDExtension and C# as well. Yes, it is possible with implicit `Callable` handling, but explicit and documented property hint looks better.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#define ADD_TOOL_BUTTON(m_method, m_label, m_icon) ::ClassDB::add_property(get_class_static(), PropertyInfo(Variant::NIL, \"\", PROPERTY_HINT_TOOL_BUTTON, String(m_method) + String(m_label) + String(m_icon), PROPERTY_USAGE_EDITOR | PROPERTY_USAGE_INTERNAL), StringName(), StringName())\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that to fully dynamically add tool buttons we would need to be able to pass an argument from hint string to the function, since there is no `_call()` to dynamically dispatch calls.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could implement this as a more verbose option:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\n@export_tool_button(\"Click me\") var click_button: Callable = click_action\r\n\r\nfunc click_action():\r\n    print(\"Clicked!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow you to use lambdas:\r\n\r\n```gdscript\r\n@export_tool_button(\"Click me\") var click_button: Callable = func ():\r\n    print(\"Clicked!\")\r\n```","submittedAt":"2024-09-26T08:01:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"dalexeev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good to me. @Macksaur Thanks again for your work and patience!","submittedAt":"2024-09-27T21:15:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-29T15:20:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-29T15:33:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"LRJiao"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-29T15:36:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lyuma"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Curious if you've considered having a split bottom radius and top radius, to allow tapered cones (cylinder with different top and bottom).\r\n\r\nalso curious if it would be easier to add this functionality to the existing cylinder type rather than make a whole new type.\r\n\r\n(Note for context that I had a discussion last year with some industry people e.g. Pixar who mentioned that their application requires capsules with different top and bottom radius, and this language exists in the KHR_physics_shape draft.

Although I can agree only with the addition of pull-down menus (or right-click menus) and the addition of shortcuts, but I do not agree with the addition of buttons.\r\n\r\nThere are other methods to move the timeline cursor besides keyframes, such as moving to the snap position, but it is not made a button. Also, since we are planning to add markers in https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/91765, there is a possibility of moving to markers, but I don't think that all of them should be made into buttons for moving the timeline cursor in the same line with playback button. So I do not think that keyframes should be treated specially.\r\n\r\nThe play button should only be for the playback (`play()` or `stop()`) API, and if you want to add a button for movement, I believe it should be on a separate line or Somewhere completely recognizable as different from the playback API, like:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ead8b7ce-1fd7-4e1c-8d1c-a2e82e99f9e9)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think this PR can be approvable if the buttons are removed.","submittedAt":"2024-08-31T21:39:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_DOWN","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"TokageItLab"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I think it works well.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it is weird that the tooltip description for playback from the end is exactly the same for backward and forward playback, so I think some different wording is needed.

This means a project setting to define the OIDN path should likely be added.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nWhen trying to bake from a release export template compiled with `module_lightmapper_rd_enabled=yes module_xatlas_unwrap_enabled=yes`, I get a crash. Backtrace from gdb (as Godot's crash handler isn't working here for some reason):\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#0  RenderingDevice::_uniform_set_update_shared (this=this@entry=0x504d980,

The fact it's under the `android` section should be sufficient to point out the setting is only active on Android.\r\n\r\n > This option uses the --use_immersive functionality that already existed.\r\n\r\nI like the approach of re-using the `--use_immersive` functionality and I think we can update the PR logic to only use that approach for both the editor and the play/game window. In order to do so\r\n- The logic in `editor_run` should be moved to [`GodotEditor#onNewGodotInstanceRequested(...)`](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/db76de5de8a415b29be4c7dd84b99bd0fe260822/platform/android/java/editor/src/main/java/org/godotengine/editor/GodotEditor.kt#L192). \r\n- As done in `editor_run`, the logic should check if `immersive_mode` is enabled, and if so add the immersive flag in the `args` parameter if it doesn't contain it already.\r\n  - With this approach, the PR should only require changes in `editor_settings` to introduce the setting, and in `GodotEditor` to update the launch parameters as needed\r\n  - This also means that the project settings will not launch in immersive mode when launch from the library, but I think that's fine as the primary use case is to have the editor window in immersive mode.

This shader is texture read bound (especially if using glow, or FXAA etc.), so the extra instructions will be hidden by the usual latency hiding mechanisms. \r\n\r\nIt still makes sense to use the optimized form for two reasons:\r\n1. Its better for mobile devices as it will use less battery (despite not running faster)\r\n2. Its better if we end up copying this code in another part of the engine that may be more instruction-sensitive","submittedAt":"2024-09-24T22:12:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Chaosus"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-19T05:01:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Chaosus"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-19T05:07:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Chaosus"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-19T05:25:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"10Drenth"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-19T05:39:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Chaosus"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I think it's a correct now, great, thanks.","submittedAt":"2024-06-21T13:49:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T10:10:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"10Drenth"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T10:13:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T11:06:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-20T12:54:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-20T10:02:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Repiteo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-20T13:12:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Repiteo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-20T13:16:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-20T13:50:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Bromeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks great, thanks so much!

Now I've parsed it more carefully, I see why this is an improvement at several levels.\r\n\r\nA few extra requests:\r\n1. I found it a bit hard to tell `ref_pointer_no_init()` from `ref_pointer()`. I'd suggest merging both like this (not tested, but you get the idea; not sure how doable in `Variant::ObjData::ref()`-`ref_pointer()`):\r\n```C++\r\ntemplate<bool Init = False>\r\n_FORCE_INLINE_ void ref_pointer(T *p_refcounted) { // Note 'p_ref` -> 'p_refcounted`\r\n\tif (unlikely(p_ref == reference)) {\r\n\t\treturn;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t// Suggesting this instead of the cleanup_ref approach. Seems more straighforward and avoids dealing with the refcount more than strictly needed. Am I missing something?\r\n\tif (reference) {\r\n\t\treference->unreference();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tbool valid = false;\r\n\tif (likely(p_refcounted)) {\r\n\t\tbool valid = false;\r\n\t\tif constexpr (Init) {\r\n\t\t\tif (p_refcounted->init_ref()) {\r\n\t\t\t\tvalid = true;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tif (p_refcounted->reference()) {\r\n\t\t\t\tvalid = true;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\treference = likely(valid) ? p_refcounted : nullptr;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. As in the code above, it'd be good to use `likely()`/`unlikely()` in the null checks and identity checks throughout. The former code failed to do so, but I think it's worth while you're at it.\r\n3. Maybe opinionated, but I find `ptr` easier to parse than `ptr != null`, especially in this sort of code.\r\n4. In the various functions that are implemented as `*this = p_from;`, I'd suggest being explicit about the call to `ref*()`. After all, anyone trying to wrap their head around this code will have to check how `operator=` is implemented anyway.\r\n5. Now I don't see much reason any longer to have separate commits, unless the first one could be a pure fix and the second one a pure refactor. Otherwise, I'd ask you to squash them back.\r\n\r\nI'm aware this looks like a lot of changes, but it's just a little refinement over your work.

tried to play with it, and to be honest, it was not so useful. However, I feel that the main problem depends on the complexity of the GUI and the number of clicks for this feature. So here are some suggestions for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Node Groups should be editable in the inspector if possible, rather than in the bottom editor\r\n\r\nThis would allow group assignments to be made immediately when a node is selected.\r\n\r\nHowever, since `AnimationNodeAnimation` and `AnimationNodeStateMachineTransition` already have objects registered directly in the inspector, there may be conflicts. So it may be necessary to implement your own inspector plugin like `EditarInspecutorPluginAnimationTrackKeyEdit`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Need fewer buttons and the group names need to be easily editable\r\n\r\nIt is tedious to have tabs in the bottom editor and toggle them by buttons. There should be a LineEdit, or having right click menu, or having pencil button next to the name to rename it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Show/hide needs to be a toggle type as we don't know the current state\r\n\r\nThis needs to be a toggle, just as the scene tree dock is. I also think it must be a checkbox, not an eye icon, to let people know that it is a filter. This is because unassigned groups should always be displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## I don't see why the number of groups needs to be a constant array\r\n\r\nIf they are to be listed with naming, they should be a dynamic list basically.\r\n\r\nOr it should be a bitmask, like a collision layer. Then, the layer data should not be stored in each node in each StateMachine as array.\r\n\r\nThat is, if constants are used, `PackedInt32Array node_group_selections;` should be `uint_16 node_group_selections;`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have a group name for the bitmask, you could have it in EditorSetting, as the CollisionLayer does, and display it where you need it; it means that you should have a separate list of names from the bitmask. Also, if you need to manage the names each StateMachine, you could consider storing it in the StateMachine using the TOOLS_ENABLED block and let the StateMachine inspector manage it.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you use a dynamic list (don't use bitmask), `PackedInt32Array node_group_selections;` should be Vector<int> node_group_selections;`, but there are a few performance concerns.\r\n\r\nTaken together with the above input, a mock that would improve this would look like below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/61938263/cceeb8e3-1443-49bc-b5eb-fcdce64acf14)\r\n\r\nIf it adapts to bitmask and a simpler GUI, it become like below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/61938263/d36e126d-bd88-4936-8ac6-2effbb964325)\r\n\r\nFYI, the last image is almost the same as the Layer bitmask feature that groups the display and hide of the blender.","submittedAt":"2024-06-29T14:36:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-18T15:53:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-18T15:54:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"TokageItLab"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Working

For (mostly) opaque weapon models, this new approach is clearly better.\r\n\r\n- Models with clip perspective can still cast and receive shadows, including from other objects in the scene. The perspective scale does not affect the position at which shadows are received, which I think makes sense for this use case.\r\n\r\n- Screen-space effects no longer affect the model that uses clip scale and a low Z clip scale, but this is expected. We should make sure to document this, as I don't see a way to resolve this.\r\n\r\n- **Z Clip Scale** and **Perspective Scale** should be hidden in the inspector if **Use Clip Scale** is unchecked.\r\n\r\n- The perspective scale multiplier is inverted compared to what I'm typically expecting. Higher values result in a *lower* FOV, instead of a higher FOV. This might not be a problem, but I thought I'd mention it nonetheless.\r\n\r\n- Meshes parented to the camera occasionally disappear with low perspective scale (= high FOV). See the example below with the weapon, which is made of multiple MeshInstance3D nodes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/def097f0-ee0e-49fb-b439-ea4090d8cc68\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to work around this one by setting a large custom AABB to the weapon model (as it's always visible anyway), but this isn't exposed in the Advanced Import Settings dialog yet.\r\n","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T22:28:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T07:35:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T10:17:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T16:19:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"RadiantUwU"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T16:37:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T16:39:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"dsnopek"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\r\n\r\nI

This is a great start :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\n**Testing project:** [test_pr_93041.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15840855/test_pr_93041.zip)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/94986f0d-9dd0-4597-a2f5-013fce56cd0b\r\n\r\nSome feedback:\r\n\r\n- I think the Hybrid mode's UI is pretty good as it is; It behaves exactly as I expect it to. It's a good way to cater to both controller and keyboard/mouse users effectively.\r\n\r\n- The OptionButton's minimum width isn't increased to account for the icons' width (including their padding), which means long option names get cut off.\r\n\r\n- The action of changing the item should follow the BaseButton's **Action Mode** property. By default, the item change should occur when the mouse button is *released*, not when it's pressed. This should be done on both Hybrid and Carousel mode, both when clicking the arrows and when clicking the item name in Carousel.\r\n  - The only exception to this rule is the dropdown appearance in Hybrid, which should always appear on button press to follow macOS and Linux UI guidelines.\r\n \r\n- There should be a boolean property to disable wraparound behavior. In this case, the Previous/Next arrows should be modulated with a \"disabled color\" theme item when the carousel is already at the first/last item.\r\n  - This property should only be displayed in the inspector when **Type** is **Hybrid** or **Carousel**. This can be done by implementing `_validate_property()` in OptionButton and calling `notify_property_list_changed()` in `set_type()` when the type has changed from its previous value.\r\n  - In fact, I think wraparound behavior should be disabled by default, but it's worth surveying various well-known game UIs to see what they do. In general, I tend to prefer **not** having wraparound because it makes it easier to [crank everything all the way up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6oEBrAYowg) :wink: \r\n \r\n- There should be hover feedback when hovering and pressing the arrows. This can be done by adding theme items where the user can specify icon modulations color for hovered and pressed icons, similar to what's present in other Control nodes. (Pressing takes priority over hovering, of course.)\r\n- When in Carousel mode, it should be possible to right-click the button to go backwards (with left-clicking going forwards as usual). Wraparound should also occur in this case when reaching the first item (it should go to the last item).\r\n- Consider implementing the bottom blips indicator as mentioned in the original proposal, as this greatly improves carousel usability in my experience. Thanks to blips, users no longer have to click through all options to see how many options are actually available if the button is in Carousel mode :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T16:21:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T16:51:56Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"dalexeev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T16:58:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-12T07:59:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"dalexeev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-12T08:20:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T14:40:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"Calinou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T14:42:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-28T12:37:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-08-27T12:52:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Will try out this code later today or tomorrow hopefully","submittedAt":"2024-08-27T12:56:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Tested briefly and works as expected in my basic testing, except for the earlier code suggestions above this looks good to me but TIWAGOS\r\n\r\nOne minor usability detail I notice that might be worth to improve is that when you have finished adding a polygon it clears the current tool, so you have to press the add point button again, this was in place originally I'd assume because you replaced the polygon if finishing a new one, but I think you should keep the add point tool now, but that's all the usability details I can speak for in my testing","submittedAt":"2024-08-28T13:02:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"groud"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T13:36:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T13:39:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"groud"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T13:42:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T13:43:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"groud"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-09-03T13:45:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"rburing"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-06T21:05:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"kleonc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T00:44:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rburing"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-10-07T21:11:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Riteo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for the delay.

In this case, I'm even more CPU-bottlenecked but this PR wins out over `master`.\r\n\r\nEither way, I figure I'd point this out as this may point out at some scalability issues in the new code (e.g. methods that have `O(N²)` scaling has replaced methods that were previously `O(N)`).\r\n\r\n<details open>\r\n\r\n<summary>PC specifications</summary>\r\n\r\n- **CPU:** Intel Core i9-13900K\r\n- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\r\n- **RAM:** 64 GB (2×32 GB DDR5-5800 C30)\r\n- **SSD:** Solidigm P44 Pro 2 TB\r\n- **OS:** Linux (Fedora 39)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n```\r\n10.0878296476422ms avg draw time (99 samples)\r\n10.0065517907191ms avg draw time (198 samples)\r\n9.94229878640737ms avg draw time (297 samples)\r\n9.96660463737719ms avg draw time (396 samples)\r\n9.95996937607274ms avg draw time (495 samples)\r\n9.95242515396992ms avg draw time (594 samples)\r\n9.94330463987408ms avg draw time (693 samples)\r\n9.93462313305248ms avg draw time (792 samples)\r\n9.93317573025037ms avg draw time (891 samples)\r\n9.9287399137863ms avg draw time (990 samples)\r\n9.92602815969588ms avg draw time (1089 samples)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n```\r\n4.75202184734922ms avg draw time (99 samples)\r\n4.6268870132138ms avg draw time (198 samples)\r\n4.60077375675291ms avg draw time (297 samples)\r\n4.57970060483374ms avg draw time (396 samples)\r\n4.56591904765428ms avg draw time (495 samples)\r\n4.56037465169374ms avg draw time (594 samples)\r\n4.5561594364447ms avg draw time (693 samples)\r\n4.55680308919964ms avg draw time (792 samples)\r\n4.55250055032681ms avg draw time (891 samples)\r\n4.55153975823913ms avg draw time (990 samples)\r\n4.55042635004273ms avg draw time (1089 samples)\r\n```","submittedAt":"2024-06-10T10:13:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"kitbdev"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- fixes https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/93036 (after its fixed)\r\n\r\nIt looks like `queue_redraw` has an issue that lets it be called multiple times in a frame, and it is not specifically related to TextEdit or CodeEdit.

Otherwise, you have to scroll down the list a lot to find non-built-in actions. I think most of the time, you'll still want to select your own actions as opposed to built-in actions when built-in actions are allowed.\r\n- Should `allow_builtin` be renamed to `show_builtin`? If `allow_builtin` is not used, you can still manually enter the name of a built-in action and the inspector won't prevent you from doing so. I think that behavior is fine, but we should be careful about semantics here.\r\n- When you add/remove/rename an action, the inspector isn't updated automatically. This means it can display outdated state, with actions that don't exist anymore (and newly created actions won't show up). It'll only update when you select another node, or collapse then expand the subresource that contains the input action.","submittedAt":"2024-06-17T21:09:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"kleonc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Was just looking into this too. :smile:\r\n\r\nMissing docs.\r\n\r\nAlso while at it:\r\n- there's missing guard in `TileMapLayer::set_use_kinematic_bodies`,\r\n- in `TileMapLayer::set_rendering_quadrant_size` dirty flag should be set after the error and assignment.","submittedAt":"2024-06-05T10:47:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"kleonc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The code LGTM, haven't tested though. :upside_down_face:\r\n\r\n+Still you could address:\r\n> Also while at it:\r\n> * there's missing guard in `TileMapLayer::set_use_kinematic_bodies`,\r\n>  * in `TileMapLayer::set_rendering_quadrant_size` dirty flag should be set after the error and assignment.","submittedAt":"2024-06-05T15:51:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"kleonc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-05T16:07:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"kleonc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Rechecked the changes, noticed only another little typo in the docs.

To resolve this, motion blur intensity should probably be set to 0 initially and ramp up over the number of frames defined by the sample count.\r\n\r\nThe motion blur falls apart when there are transparent surfaces close to the camera (such as particles or glass), which is an unfortunate consequence of motion vectors not being written by transparent surfaces. I don't know a good solution to this, but we should see if it's possible to skip motion blur entirely on those pixels. This should only be done in certain scenarios though, not on *all* transparent materials (e.g. you wouldn't want a car's windshield to ignore motion blur when viewed from outside). I wonder if https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77523 would help here.\r\n\r\nThe motion blur intensity is framerate-dependent in this PR, which I think is a reasonable default for the reasons outlined in the proposal's comments. The default intensity seems a bit low for 60 FPS – I bumped it to `1.0` personally (e.g. in the above video), but I would make it `0.5` at the very least. I'm using a 120 Hz OLED display, so your perception of motion blur may differ from mine (particularly if you're using a VA display, due to their slow response times).\r\n\r\nMotion blur doesn't appear to be resolution-dependent, which is good.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think this should be implemented as a core camera effect as opposed to a compositor effect. The effect is hardcoded either way, so there isn't much benefit to having it as a built-in compositor effect. If we intend to migrate core effects to compositor effects, we should do that in separate PRs and do this for all effects, not just one.","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T23:00:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":10}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T00:29:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"RedMser"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T08:38:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T09:00:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T09:01:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T09:01:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T15:12:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-03T14:18:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-02T20:27:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-02T20:27:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"kleonc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-02T20:31:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-02T20:32:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"kleonc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-02T20:35:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Riteo"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Very nice!

This already seems to be in place for the Overdraw debug mode, but not other debug draw modes.","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T15:24:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"},{"author":{"login":"clayjohn"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T15:50:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ChristopheClaustre"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T18:24:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"clayjohn"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-11T20:42:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ChristopheClaustre"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-12T07:30:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ChristopheClaustre"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-12T07:38:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Calinou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-12T15:19:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ChristopheClaustre"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-13T07:40:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ChristopheClaustre"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-13T22:10:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Calinou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-14T15:39:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"ChristopheClaustre"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-16T18:43:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"clayjohn"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Looks great to me.

When **Keep Width** is used, horizontal FOV should not increase when the window is made wider.\r\n\r\n- Panini projection asks for a FOV, but this FOV always appears to be an horizontal FOV value, while it should be interpreted as a vertical FOV value when the **Keep Height** aspect mode is used (the default). When using **Keep Width**, it should be interpreted as an horizontal FOV as it is currently.\r\n  - Changing this will make the default of 150 too high, so I suggest decreasing it to 100 or so, perhaps even 90.\r\n\r\n### Rendering\r\n\r\n- At low FOV (< 100), the low resolution of the cubemap becomes obvious. At very high FOV (> 250), visible aliasing can be noticed due to the cubemap resolution being too high.\r\n\r\n![Low-resolution cubemap](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/dd421897-20b8-42c5-9a57-e2d5f5401a48)\r\n\r\n- Very high FOV (above 350) has visible streaks on the edges of the screen. I suggest clamping the FOV to 350 in the inspector (instead of 359) to avoid this.\r\n\r\n![FOV 359](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/548fdb89-0a23-4eb9-94a5-b98012a47eb2)\r\n\r\n- SDFGI doesn't work when using a camera with panini projection. It does impact performance, but it has no visible result on the scene rendering. VoxelGI and LightmapGI both work.\r\n\r\n- FXAA and TAA operate on the output view, not the internal cubemap faces. This means aliasing is still visible on the screen's edges as they are quite undersampled.\r\n\r\n- When TAA is enabled, lots of ghosting are visible when the camera moves fast on certain cubemap faces. FSR2 isn't as subject to this issue, even at resolution scales lower than 1.0.\r\n\r\n- SSAO and SSIL work, but there are seams between cubemap faces. Example with SSIL at intensity 6 to make the seam more obvious:\r\n\r\n![SSIL seams](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/4c5e2fe5-d447-42b0-b63b-9978980d1d8a)\r\n\r\n- Volumetric fog has visible seams between cubemap faces. The higher the temporal reprojection factor is, the more visible they are. Disabling temporal reprojection gets rid of the seams entirely.\r\n\r\n![Volumetric fog seams with temporal reprojection](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/b4161202-93a2-4672-8bf0-3f43847e7e5b)\r\n\r\n## Benchmark\r\n\r\nThe performance impact is pretty high. To reduce the performance impact, most other engines I've seen use cheaper screen-space approximations to this effect (perhaps using up to 4 views for very high FOV, but sticking to a single oversampled view for most conventional FOV values).\r\n\r\nAll tests done with an optimized editor build (`optimize=speed lto=full`).\r\n\r\n<details open>\r\n\r\n<summary>PC specifications</summary>\r\n\r\n- **CPU:** Intel Core i9-13900K\r\n- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\r\n- **RAM:** 64 GB (2×32 GB DDR5-5800 C30)\r\n- **SSD:** Solidigm P44 Pro 2 TB\r\n- **OS:** Linux (Fedora 39)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Standard 1152x648\r\n\r\nForward+ | Mobile | Compatibility\r\n-|-|-\r\n3261 FPS (0.31 mspf) | 3185 FPS (0.31 mspf) | 2347 FPS (0.43 mspf)\r\n\r\n## Standard 3840x2160\r\n\r\nForward+ | Mobile | Compatibility\r\n-|-|-\r\n920 FPS (1.09 mspf) | 1570 FPS (0.64 mspf) | 1430 FPS (0.70 mspf)\r\n\r\n## Panini 1152x648\r\n\r\nForward+ | Mobile | Compatibility\r\n-|-|-\r\n1030 FPS (0.97 mspf) | *N/A* | *N/A*\r\n\r\n## Panini 3840x2160\r\n\r\nForward+ | Mobile | Compatibility\r\n-|-|-\r\n206 FPS (4.85 mspf) | *N/A* | *N/A*\r\n","submittedAt":"2024-05-30T22:38:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":6}}],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Your routine \"[comment style](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/code_style_guidelines.html#comment-style-guide)\" checking.","submittedAt":"2024-06-21T09:05:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"tomas-g03"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-28T11:16:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-29T09:20:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"bruvzg"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-29T09:44:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"hccloud"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-30T02:14:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"hccloud"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-30T02:27:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-29T08:49:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-29T08:57:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-29T06:42:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-27T14:18:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-29T07:03:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-29T07:02:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"Calinou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Tested locally, it mostly works as expected.\r\n\r\nThere's a visible precision loss in the movie output compared to the window output (i.e. what I see in the window).

In my opinion, the syntax should be `for key: KeyType, value: ValueType in iterable`. Because a. the type is not separated from the identifier, and b. `key: Type, value` is less confusing than `key, value: Type` if you omit the value's type hint.\r\n\r\n2\\. GDScript is a gradually typed programming language, so we do not require static typing anywhere.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/47700418/b63fb746-70cc-41a9-9d3e-02a8dfc6bf1c)\r\n\r\nIn case the iterable value is a supertype of `Dictionary` (i.e. `Variant`), there should be no compile-time error, only the second iterator variable should be marked as unsafe.\r\n\r\nType checking should be performed at runtime, if necessary. If the value turns out to be a dictionary, then ok. If not, then there must be a runtime error. You can implement this either in the compiler (by generating type checking code if necessary, much like we did for `match`) or by adding new opcode(s) for the VM.\r\n\r\n3\\. The type of the second iterator variable is not converted for implicitly convertible types (like `int` and `float`) and does not cause a runtime error for incompatible types.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/47700418/8e69b057-6686-4b15-a2d2-af523e85ee88)\r\n![](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/47700418/9b7f1ea3-4f76-48d3-a9ea-bc0c52e4c6e2)\r\n\r\nThis is inconsistent with the behavior of the first iterator variable.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/47700418/7bf05b57-114b-4c8f-a8fb-2a1ccba8a0e0)\r\n![](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/47700418/6a28e3c5-e512-41c5-ab3c-01ccc02928b8)\r\n\r\nTo fix the first, you need to replace `use_conversion_assign` with `first_use_conversion_assign` and `second_use_conversion_assign`.

So we end up copying the same memory several times:\r\n1. Our base image (fully in memory before compression)\r\n2. 1 copy of each mip level\r\n3.

This PR removes number 2 for the base mip level (which accounts for the most memory usage) but leaves the other levels alone.

think the code and everything make sense, though I haven't tested it, but I'm not convinced this is necessary to put in core, I'm not sure I see the specific need to be able to fetch all the points directly, I'd probably expect any usage of this for things like drawing to just iterate over the positions and using the `get_point_position` or similar, I'm less sure about the usefulness of fetching all the points at once, especially since it doesn't consider solid points so any such checking would require further testing (which couldn't be done with this output anyway as the solid check checks for the grid points)\r\n\r\nAlso any user who might be interested in the points in any other ordering, like by column, or right to left instead etc. couldn't use this\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure about the

This adds more lines of code but it's worth it, because now it will exclude empty buffers. I wonder if this would affect GLTFDocumentExtension classes, though? Regardless I think it's good to have GLTFDocumentExtension classes check for a buffer before trying to write one, so I think your fix here is good.\r\n\r\n> Allow the case where root_nodes is empty.\r\n\r\nI agree, this is allowed by the spec and should be allowed by Godot for non-scene glTF files. However note that the code in this PR is not sufficient to actually handle that case. If you export a scene with only the root node with MULTI_ROOT, there is currently a check for `if (child_count > 0) {` that will prevent MULTI_ROOT from being used in this case. However, removing that check is not sufficient by itself, because that causes the file to not be able to be imported back into Godot since it's not a scene, and also the `\"scene\"` and `\"scenes\"` would also need to be excluded. In order for the feature of non-scene glTF files to be made useful, we would need to implement https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/7494 to allow importing glTF files as other resource types.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: The changes in this PR are good, but the use case of empty root_nodes is not working yet.

As such, besides witnessing the code changes look solid and sensible, I can only raise a few nitpicks:\r\n- `driver_clear_resources_with_views` and the other bool member above could become bitfields.\r\n- Also for `driver_clear_resources_with_views`, I'd suggest a rename to the more compact `driver_uses_views_for_clears`. Or, alternatively, inverting its meaning and naming it `driver_clears_via_copy_engine`, or something similar. (The rename would carry over to `API_TRAIT_CLEAR_RESOURCES_WITH_VIEWS`.)\r\n- I've spotted a few pieces of code style that deviate from the latest best or estabilished practices in the codebase. That was already the case in some of these files, so I think we'd rather do a style-fixing pass later. They are things such as uninitialized local variables and the omission of the (superfluous, I know) `public` keyword in the specification of inheritance across structs.\r\n- Finally, there's the `thread_local LocalVector` technique. That's kind of a safer `alloca()`, isn't it? I guess we should discuss rules about when to prefer that over the `ALLOCA_ARRAY()` utility macro that drivers use, which may mean we let the drivers do the same, but in any case come up with something consistent.","submittedAt":"2024-05-10T15:42:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"clayjohn"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This seems fine to me to merge for 4.3.

Mainly, these methods feel too \"technical\", \"mechanical\" to be needing to be exposed. The additional documentation does not help. Yes, these are used _by the engine_, but what can the _user_... use this for?\r\nThe above questioning is why we decided to \"unexpose\" Resource's `setup_local_to_scene` (https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67082). The method is literally just an internal method exposed for little to no reason: The user could implement it on their own, and documenting its internal purpose was difficult.

That said, I'd say the access mode should also be `ACCESS_FILESYSTEM` for the same reasons as the editor.\r\n    - `Engine::get_singleton()->is_editor_hint()` should be used here to differentiate editor and running project.\r\n- We should use a file extension different than `.cpl`, as this extension is already used by Windows for control panel items. This causes Windows Explorer to have a default file association that doesn't make sense. `.pal` and `.plt` are already taken by various other apps still in use today, but `.ple` seems mostly unused (only Windows Live Messenger used it for encrypted chat logs in the 2000s).","submittedAt":"2024-05-09T00:31:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"Calinou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-09T00:32:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Calinou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-09T00:32:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Calinou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Tested locally, it mostly works as expected.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/b4f105e6-f9ce-4e05-841d-7b3dc4e052ce\r\n\r\nI still noticed some issues though:\r\n\r\n- There are inconsistencies when saving/loading palettes across different ColorPicker nodes that have the same palette loaded. The dirty marker (`*`) isn't always present when it should be, for instance. You can see a few instances of this in the above video.\r\n- I *sometimes* can't remove certain colors from a palette by right-clicking them. I'm not sure what triggers this exactly.\r\n- Loading palettes from a running project doesn't seem to work (saving works - you can load the palette from a running project in the editor).\r\n- The save/load buttons should expand the Swatches section of the ColorPicker when you successfully save or load a swatch. Right now, if the Swatches section is still collapsed, it'll appear like the buttons do nothing after selecting a file.\r\n- The save button should be hidden if there are no colors in the swatch yet. In this situation, only loading a palette makes sense.","submittedAt":"2024-05-12T23:43:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"CHANGES_REQUESTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-14T17:18:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"nongvantinh"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-14T17:22:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-15T16:57:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-15T17:12:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-15T17:14:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-15T17:15:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-15T17:15:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-16T09:16:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-17T12:19:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-17T12:31:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-17T12:32:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-17T12:32:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-17T12:32:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-17T12:58:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-18T07:48:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-18T07:49:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-18T07:51:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-18T11:22:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T12:25:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T12:51:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T12:57:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T12:58:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T13:00:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T13:02:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T13:03:57Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T13:04:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"KoBeWi"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-05-19T13:11:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state"

If we are going to replace this functionality, then we should replace everything. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm not sure this PR fully replaces the checkboxes anyway. One thing the checkbox communicated was whether or not the instance contains data to replace the default value. Although it appears that part of the functionality is missing. \r\n\r\nI'm not 100% certain, but this is what I think the behaviour was supposed to be.\r\n1. When a new instance shader parameter is added and it has a default in the shader, the box is unchecked indicating that it doesn't have a value in the instance, but it can be reset to the default value in the shader\r\n2. If the value is changed, then the box becomes checked because the instance now has a value\r\n3. if the box is clicked on, then the value is reset to the default from the shader and the instance now has a value\r\n4. if a new instance shader parameter is added without a default, there is no box and no ability to reset the value, but the value can be set manually. \r\n\r\nTesting locally, I can reproduce those 4 behaviors above. What I am unsure about is if that behaviour is worth keeping.

(rebased on top of `master`), it works as expected.\r\n\r\nSome feedback:\r\n\r\n- [ ] SCons' stdout appears in the terminal but not in the editor Output panel. With the new process management classes, would it be possible to display it in the editor Output panel? https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/92209 will take care of the ANSI escape codes from the colored prints.\r\n\r\n- [x] Should the **Library Name** field use the `is_valid_identifier()` method to check for validity? Its tooltip says it must be a valid identifier on its own, unlike **Base Name**. I believe *most* programming languages are aligned on GDScript's requirements for identifiers, so enforcing this probably makes sense. Note that `is_valid_identifier()` allows non-ASCII characters, so another method must be used as well to check whether only ASCII characters were entered (if this is required).\r\n\r\n- [x] Adding multiple extensions in the same project with this dialog will result in errors:\r\n   - > Attempt to register extension class 'ExampleNode', which appears to be already registered.\r\n   - > Attempt to register extension method 'hello' for unexisting class 'ExampleNode'.`\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, I suggest using the plugin path as a suffix to the the node name created by the extension numeric suffix (e.g. `ExampleNodeExtensionDemo` for an add-on in the `extension_demo` folder).\r\n\r\n- [ ] The example extension code should probably print something in its constructor (or `NOTIFICATION_READY`), so you see it having an effect right away when it's added to the scene tree. Also, its `hello()` method should either print text directly (and return `void`), or be renamed to something like `get_greeting_text()` as it currently doesn't print and returns a String instead.\r\n\r\n- [x] The line \"Both Git and SCons were found.\" should also tell you that you need a C++17-compatible compiler (GCC, Clang or MSVC). The \"or MSVC\" part should only be displayed on Windows. Something like this:\r\n  - > Both Git and SCons were found. You will also need a C++17-compatible compiler such as (GCC or Clang|GCC, Clang or MSVC).\r\n\r\n- [x] When using the C++ as GDExtension or engine module option, the last line of the creation dialog should be yellow, as it's a warning:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/ec20c9e2-1223-4755-b60e-2dfc1838fc12)\r\n\r\n- [x] The form considers it valid to use non-digit characters in the compatibility minimum/maximum version fields. Also, using a minimum version (`4.4`) greater than the current editor version (`4.3`) is currently not prevented. This leads to an error if you confirm the dialog.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/4bfe893a-999f-409e-9fce-b3ca95708b93)\r\n\r\n- [ ] We should figure out how to handle this in the [Flatpak](https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot), as there won't be a C++ compiler, Git or SCons available for it to run.

As an end-user I'd rather have a working product that's a bit slower than an unstable (or worse: remotely exploitable) product that's imperceptibly faster, and I'm not even sure this will end up being faster.

In which case, you *still* would want to store the names in a constant as for best practice.\r\n- Changing layers around is not something you should do frequently.\r\n     - Even with the above methods existing, you would still need to account for **PackedScenes** in your project, which cannot automatically change. For this case, a refactoring tool for layers would be FAR more beneficial, instead.\r\n- The implementation sounds nice, but in actual practice it becomes quite the mouthful, due of primarily existing in the **ProjectSettings** class.\r\nGDScript is no stranger to verbosity, but...\r\n    ```GDScript\r\n    func _ready():\r\n        collision_mask |= \r\n    ProjectSettings.find_layer(ProjectSettings.LAYER_PHYSICS_2D, \"player\")\r\n    ```\r\n    Compare this to using user-defined scripts to achieve the same thing, and it does become questionable.\r\n    ```GDScript\r\n    func _ready():\r\n        collision_mask |= Global.find_physics_layer(\"player\")\r\n    ```\r\n    Or:\r\n    ```GDScript\r\n    func _ready():\r\n        collision_mask |= Global.COLLISION_LAYER_PLAYER\r\n    ```\r\n    - This makes me question if **ProjectSettings** really is the best place for these, whereas they _could_ be static methods of the respective classes of interest.\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nI see a bit of ambiguity with `get_layer_count`. You may think it's the maximum number of available layers, but it can also be interpreted as \"how many layers have been defined by the user\".\r\n\r\nAlso **very** nitpicky: I see the current code in this PR to be a bit hard to keep track of. In the (_unlikely_) case where, say, a new set of layers is added, both of the new methods would have to be modified to account for them.","submittedAt":"2024-06-27T09:08:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-06-27T09:22:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"fire"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The changes look good.

Just a few notes.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is our goal with this warning? Implicit conversion causing copying is bad because:\r\n\r\n1. It is not obvious that the result is that the source and target refer to different objects. The user may expect to be passed by reference, but the result is that the objects become independent.\r\n2. Copying a large array can affect performance.\r\n3. Implicit conversion can be confusing in principle. However, this also applies to types that are passed by reference, so we will not consider this issue within this PR.\r\n\r\nI think we're primarily concerned with point 1, not 2. This has a few implications:\r\n\r\n1. If the source is an array literal, then there should be no warning, since you will not be able to access the literal array, only the converted result. `var pba: PackedByteArray = []`, `my_func([])`, etc. are valid use cases for the implicit conversion feature. Unlike `var pba: PackedByteArray = array`, `my_func(array)`.\r\n2. I'm not sure if there should be a warning if the target (and the source) is a constant. Yes, these will be different arrays, but you will not be able to modify the contents of the constant. However, since we have the bug #67873, we probably can't think about it for now.\r\n3. I'm not sure if an implicit conversion when passing an argument to an annotation should raise a warning, since annotations require constant arguments and you probably won't be able to access the converted array (but it's theoretically possible in the future).

Here's an illustration of the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Output\r\nblend shape vertex: (-0.5,0,0)\r\nnormal: (0.05, 0, 0.99)\r\n\r\n# During import\r\nnormal = (0,0,1) + (0.05, 0, 0.99) = (0.05,0,1.99)\r\n\r\n# After normalization\r\nresult = (0.025,0,0.995)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of this process is that the normal appears less pronounced than it should be. This effect is subtle and can be difficult to detect, as it only applies to certain blend shapes under specific lighting conditions. We need to address this bug to ensure accurate representation of normals in all scenarios.","submittedAt":"2024-03-14T01:29:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"fire"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Needs to pass cicd but looks good.

I left a comment on a typo in the docs. \r\n\r\nAlso, we need to clamp these values in the GLTF exporter which I think is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/7d2ca2d8ac49cde9767e00b70f9eaf1920eb266d/modules/gltf/gltf_document.cpp#L3660-L3661. GLTF does not allow values outside the 0-1 range. \r\n\r\nI don't know if there is anywhere else that metallic and roughness are consumed, but you will need to check there as well. Once you do that, it should be fine to merge.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the shader this shouldn't result in a runtime cost as `min()` gets added as an instruction modifier when it surrounds another instruction. So instead of a MUL instruction, these lines should be using MUL_MIN instructions (as an aside, if you have a `min()` instruction on its own, it still issues a MUL_MIN, but multiples by 1.0)\r\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, if it was any less trivial I wouldn't be in favour of merging this without more user support. This proposal doesn't have any user support outside of the person who made the proposal and it promotes a workflow that is widely unsupported everywhere. So even if it works fine in Godot, we will be encouraging users to create assets that can't be easily transferred to other programs.

This should occur every time you type a character, so this should be done in the `text_changed` signal.\r\n  - If no item is visible, the existing selection shouldn't change.\r\n- Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> while focusing on the filter field should act as if you pressed <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the filename field. In other words, its `text_entered` signal should be connected to act as if the **OK** button was pressed.\r\n- When pressing up/down arrows on the file filter field, instead of moving to the beginning/end of the selection, the selection of the list of files above should be scrolled instead. This may be more complex to implement, so this one can be left to a future PR. This behavior also doesn't make as much sense in grid view, only in list view, so it's subject to discussion.\r\n\r\nImplementing all these will make the feature fully keyboard-friendly.

There's no doubt this sounds much better than IDA-ADPCM.\r\n\r\nWith a 38-second 44,100 Hz, 16-bit stereo audio file, the uncompressed WAV is 6.5 MB and the corresponding imported QOA file (in `.godot/imported`) is 1.3 MB. This is a reduction of over 5 MB, which is much greater than the file size added to export templates by this PR. Even if you only had a few seconds of mono audio to compress to QOA, you'd still easily save the ~25 KB added by this PR.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is with the different import mode required, as we don't use this approach for any other audio format (unless the source format is different, like Ogg Vorbis and MP3). I don't have a good answer to this though, as refactoring it sounds difficult.\r\n\r\nThere's also the alternative of decoding Ogg Vorbis/MP3 to uncompressed audio at load-time which could work well, at the cost of requiring more memory (it would have to be something you enable on import on specific sound effects).\r\n\r\n**Testing project:** [test_pr_88646.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/14499782/test_pr_88646.zip)[^1]\r\n\r\n[^1]: Music in the testing project by [Marc A.

While we can query based on whether the lowercased controller name contains `dualshock 4` or `dualsense`, this won't work with third-party controllers that may support these features. We may need something like `DisplayServer.has_feature()` for controllers.\r\n- Should we provide calibration methods for accelerometer + gyro that automatically set the current values as an offset for future calculations? Or should this be left to the project developers? @JibbSmart might have an idea about this.","submittedAt":"2024-02-22T21:59:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"akien-mga"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-20T10:02:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Malcolmnixon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks good to me - the optional semaphore/wait is hidden behind the DrawRequester class/API.

It's supposed to be some (reasonably) stateless helper, which abstracts and Godot-ifies where possible the API. Thanks to this approach we can reasonably split the code and minimize untangling, as all the Wayland event handling is done in one place; one keeps track of stuff and handles the DS API, while another translates, scales, marshals and whatever. Nice and tidy :)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some more context and a probably better explanation about the rationale of this class, see [this comment](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/57025#issuecomment-1587837840).\r\n\r\nRegarding the `WaylandThread` API, I'd propose a plain and simple `WaylandThread::window_set_input_rects(DisplayServer::WindowID p_window_id, Vector<Rect2i> p_rects)`. It would be basically a dumbed down copy of the update method, which just blindly sets/clears the thing depending on what's in the list. The DS would then call it depending on the flag result wherever it needs.\r\n\r\nFollowing the above logic, the DS keeps track of the rects and the flags, while the WT (WaylandThread) does the Wayland stuff ;)\r\n\r\nI hope that helps!

It's interpolated even though we're moving it every frame in `_input()` based on mouse movement, so it can move faster than the physics tick rate.\r\n\r\nThe individual white sprites (that are not nodes but created via low-level servers) are also not interpolated:\r\n\r\n### Physics interpolation disabled\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/9ecf5f35-ecec-425e-90be-fdb473905ae4\r\n\r\n### Physics interpolation enabled\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/2f6c051e-a910-4692-98d2-9ca4fae7b8f4\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nParallax backgrounds look strange when wrapping over with low physics tick rate (10 here), and they don't interpolate as smoothly as they could. They seem to interpolate in visible \"steps\", as if the interpolation was only performed for half of the physics tick length:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/godotengine/godot/assets/180032/39102d5b-6b7c-406d-a5a7-9ac8313ea9c1\r\n\r\n**Testing project:** [physics_platformer_modified.zip](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/files/14349244/physics_platformer_modified.zip)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAlso, I strongly suggest enabling physics interpolation by default. We'll need to stick to a default value once this is merged, and with high refresh rate displays slowly becoming the norm among players, it's expected that games should adapt automatically without requiring extra work from the developer's side. While this will require updating some tutorials, I believe it's worth the effort.","submittedAt":"2024-02-20T17:22:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":11}}],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lawnjelly"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-26T09:40:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lawnjelly"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-26T09:46:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Mickeon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Holy crap that's a whooping 15 comments and I'm not done yet.","submittedAt":"2024-02-26T11:02:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"rburing"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-26T22:30:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"lawnjelly"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-03-09T15:44:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"adamscott"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"What a great port.

my suggestion was a bit different from this result, but it generally follows my idea, but I think the solution for entering values with the no-signal part is a bit hacky, it also changes existing behavior in a way I don't think is appropriate without the controls for this being exposed\r\n\r\n> I think that if we are going to limit this PR to just the display in the editor we should do it with a dedicated display method, essentially one that just allows non-finites for just display, and then we can look at a broader improvement that allows input and display control too\r\n\r\nCurrently using `set_value` *or* `set_value_no_signal` from scripts blocks non-finites, but now this is changed, depending on the display value, I'd say it should instead be controlled directly by that, not indirectly as that's error prone\r\n\r\nAs I suggested I'd prefer a new method for dedicated display updates, without the `is_display_non_finite_allowed` part, instead adding a new method like `set_display_value` which ignores the whole non-finite checks\r\n\r\nWithout exposing the controls for inputting these values I don't think that code should be added in this PR, as I suggested above, they serve no purpose in this change as the editor makes no use of them\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion would be:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/scene/gui/range.cpp b/scene/gui/range.cpp\r\nindex

Sorry, I had this on my backlog to review for several months. I didn't intend for it to take so long. \r\n\r\nOne question I have is whether there is a benefit to specifying anisotropy per viewport. Previously when you changed the project setting it would change for all viewports. With this change, only the root viewport will be affected (which is technically a slight compatibility breakage). The trade off is that we can now control anisotropy on a per-viewport basis. But I'm not sure that doing so is desirable from a user point of view. \r\n\r\nCan anyone think of a situation where you would want to change anisotropy in one viewport but not another?","submittedAt":"2024-09-04T03:12:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"}]},{"reviews":[{"author":{"login":"AThousandShips"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-14T10:25:38Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"dsnopek"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\r\n\r\nOverall, this looks really nice to me :-)\r\n\r\n> Does `XRFaceTrackingProvider::update` and `XRFaceTrackingProvider::_update` need to exist, or should the updating just be done by the process() of the OpenXR extension.\r\n\r\nWhether or not we'll need the `update()` method depends on if we have any timing issues, ie will the code that updates the face tracking data run before or after we need to access it for rendering. If it runs after, that means face tracking data will be one frame delayed.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd probably lean towards keeping the `update()` method. It's possible we may not need it in the case of OpenXR (the process on the OpenXR extension may be sufficient), but since this is API agnostic and we may end up with WebXR or Apple Vision implementations at some point, I think it's safer to keep it around.","submittedAt":"2024-02-16T16:01:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Malcolmnixon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-17T01:43:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Malcolmnixon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-17T01:50:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"Malcolmnixon"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2024-02-17T01:54:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED"},{"author":{"login":"BastiaanOlij"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Feedback from discussions on contributors chat.\r\n\r\n- Suggest to rename the data object XRFaceTracker and drop the _update method.
