"mroeschke","MEMBER","Thanks for the PR, but we would require an issue to discuss the feature request (replacing `tablulate` with your implementation). This PR would also need to demonstrate that your function passes all the markdown tests.

IMO it's probably unlikely that this would be accepted into pandas since this would incur maintenance burden which was handled by tabulate. Might I suggest submitting a pull request to tabulate proposing your performance improvements","2024-10-08T18:32:58Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

I think what you should have a preamble that says ""To set a display option `OPTION`, use `pd.options.display.OPTION = value`""  Then you have a table with the various display options `max_rows`, `max_columns`, etc.

You mean generally supporting ""sum"" for strings, i.e. for both plain sum and groupby sum? 
As mentioned above (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/59430#issuecomment-2272195096), I am personally fine with making this a breaking change, but also don't feel strongly about it

Are you sure that dateutil doesn't take `dayfirst` into account? it's an argument that's passed in, and it seems to still be respected in cases when the dateutil path is used:

```python
In [11]: pd.to_datetime(['foo', '10.03.2000'], dayfirst=True, errors='coerce')
<ipython-input-11-69ca28852760>:1: UserWarning: Could not infer format, so each element will be parsed individually, falling back to `dateutil`. To ensure parsing is consistent and as-expected, please specify a format.
  pd.to_datetime(['foo', '10.03.2000'], dayfirst=True, errors='coerce')
Out[11]: DatetimeIndex(['NaT', '2000-03-10'], dtype='datetime64[s]', freq=None)

In [12]: pd.to_datetime(['foo', '10.03.2000'], errors='coerce')
<ipython-input-12-8697ff36715a>:1: UserWarning: Could not infer format, so each element will be parsed individually, falling back to `dateutil`. To ensure parsing is consistent and as-expected, please specify a format.

"simonjayhawkins","MEMBER","Thanks @jorisvandenbossche for the PDEP.

I am generally in agreement with the motivation for this PDEP on the proviso that any approval is not rejecting PDEP-10. The motivation of accepting PDEP-10 by the team members could have been related to the perceived maintenance burden, a more performant string dtype, interoperability, having better default inference for other data types or maybe some other reason. This current PDEP only addresses one aspect of that decision.

One other aspect that is not mentioned here and was not mentioned in PDEP-10 is the consequences of choosing PyArrow as a _backend_. Bearing in mind, that it was felt that the implications of using nullable semantics for default dtypes was not discussed, I wonder whether we should have a section that discusses the other implications of choosing PyArrow in this PDEP, e.g. implications of choosing 1d immutable arrays as the _backend_.","2024-05-05T10:45:01Z",false,"APPROVED"

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","Thanks for the PR. This issue is tagged as `Needs Discussion`, and I am hesitant to add this functionality to pandas' already complicated Excel reading code. This is especially true because, as the implementation currently stands, it's only supported by openpyxl.

That said, it seems to me the move of code in `parse` to it's own method (currently - your `parse_mutliindex`) is a good cleanup anyways (without the reading tables feature), and it would simplify the diff here. Would you consider doing that refactor as a pre-cursor?

I'm also curious as to why `parse_multiindex` since (I think) there isn't necessarily a MultiIndex. I would suggest `parse_sheet` instead.","2024-04-29T21:53:19Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","Thanks for the PR! It looks like you are using `**kwargs` to pass `numeric_only` in the call to `agg`. These `kwargs` are meant for the user to pass through to the function and I do not think we should be allowing ""built-in"" arguments into them. Instead, `numeric_only` should be added to the signature of `agg`.

~In addition, it appears that there are various paths through `agg` that do not respect `numeric_only`, e.g. `df.groupby(...).agg(""sum"", numeric_only=True)`.~ because `**kwargs` is passed through, this was wrong!","2024-04-15T21:50:29Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","Thanks for the PR! This appears to me to be a fairly far reaching, and I don't yet feel comfortable given that we have to consider many different cases since the user can provide an arbitrary UDF. It seems to me that the logic ""convert to pyarrow dtypes when we can"" could result in some surprising behaviors. For example:

```
df = DataFrame({""A"": [""c1"", ""c2"", ""c3""], ""B"": [100, 200, 255]})
df[""B""] = df[""B""].astype(""bool[pyarrow]"")
gb = df.groupby(""A"")

result = gb.agg(lambda x: [1, 2, 3])
print(result[""B""].dtype)
# list<item: int64>[pyarrow]

result = gb.agg(lambda x: [1, 2, ""a""])
print(result[""B""].dtype)
# object
```

While I experiment with this some more, a few questions.","2024-04-10T02:19:37Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","Two general remarks about the tests:

 - Use other pandas methods as little as possible; try to construct what you want directly.
 - It looks like many of the tests added here can be parametrized, can you give that a shot.

For the first, you can do things like

```
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        ""a"": pd.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=""...""),
        ""b"": pd.array([True, False, True], dtype=""...""),
    },
    index=pd.Index([1, 2, 3]),
)
```

instead of using `astype`, `set_index`, and the like.","2024-04-29T20:58:04Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"jorisvandenbossche","MEMBER","Thanks a lot for working on this, and apologies for the lack of reviews!

The original PR that introduced this change edited the `array_tuplesafe` function (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/57139), which is called inside `Index.__new__` before calling `_dtype_to_subclass`. So if we would change `array_tuplesafe` to still return object dtype instead of numpy S/U, that would fix it before getting to `_dtype_to_subclass`. 

The current fix also essentially allows to create an Index with an underlying numpy array with S6 dtype, while I think we want to restore the behaviour of converting to object dtype (I think my suggestion above should do that)


Other comment: could you also add a test for direct Index constructor from a Series object (i.e. `pd.Index(pd.Series(arr))`), because that is affected as well, in addition to `set_index`","2024-04-29T13:01:04Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Thanks for updating!

I've left a comment, but also, in general, this still looks very complex...if we're enforcing deprecations, then this might be a good chance to simplify the logic here?

OK with adding complexity to give a good error message if someone passes `freq='M'` instead of `'ME'`, as that's probably still fairly common, but periods are far less used

The code is currently very hard to read - which is OK as a temporary phase during which we're enforcing a deprecation - but ultimately the goal should be to end up something that's cleaner than it was when we started. Is that possible here?","2024-04-09T17:59:52Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Thanks for updating! A few things

- good to have the `c_PERIOD_TO_OFFSET_FREQSTR` dict, but I don't see why it's being used here:
  ```python
  if not is_period:
      if name.upper() in c_OFFSET_REMOVED_FREQSTR:
          raise ValueError(
              f""\'{name}\' is no longer supported for offsets. Please ""
              f""use \'{c_OFFSET_REMOVED_FREQSTR.get(name.upper())}\' ""
              f""instead.""
          )
      # below we raise for lowrecase monthly and bigger frequencies
      if (name.upper() != name and
              name.lower() not in {""h"", ""min"", ""s"", ""ms"", ""us"", ""ns""} and
              name.upper() not in c_PERIOD_TO_OFFSET_FREQSTR and
              name.upper() in c_OFFSET_TO_PERIOD_FREQSTR):
          raise ValueError(INVALID_FREQ_ERR_MSG.format(name))
  ```
  If you've already checked `if not is_period`, when why do you need to check if it's in `c_PERIOD_TO_OFFSET_FREQSTR `?
- `lowrecase` typo
- is this part temporary
  ```python
    elif name in {""d"", ""b""}:
      name = name.upper()
  elif (name.upper() not in {""B"", ""D""} and
          not name.upper().startswith(""W"")):
  ```

I think you're adding the examples to all register accessor functions, so you can add the `Examples` header to the main docstring, and then add a variable for the content of the section as it's done with `{klass}`.

Unrelated, in the examples section is not needed to create a `code-block`. You can just start the code with `>>>` and the docstring parser should understand it's code.

"datapythonista","MEMBER","Thanks for the contribution @rohanjain101 

I think both the title of the PR and the description are misleading. You are not really improving the accuracy of `to_pytimedelta`, and an increase in a nanosecond doesn't cause an increase in a microsecond when calling `to_pytimedelta`. You simply found the point where the rounding change to the next nanosecond.

I do agree that the way the function works is misleading. The problem is that most people would expect this code:

```python
>>> datetime.timedelta(microseconds=12.5)
datetime.timedelta(microseconds=12)
```

to round up to `13` instead to `12`. For good or for bad, this is how Python rounding works:

```python
>>> round(12.5)
12
```

The `round` function or the same algorithm is probably used inside of `datetime.timedelta`, so we get the behavior your experienced when using pandas `to_pytimedelta`.

The reasoning for how `round` works is complex, but it's the default rounding strategy for a reason. I'm not sure if in this particular case the rounding strategy you propose could be better. If you think there is a reason to change it, please let us know the reason in the PR description, or maybe better, open an issue to discuss.

I assume from the information provided that you just found Python's rounding strategy misleading, so I'll close this issue, but if there is a better reason than that for this PR, please feel free to add a comment and reopen.","2024-03-14T22:50:49Z",false,"COMMENTED"

Also, I was checking that we don't seem to have an automated benchmark to see if `DataFrame.update` is taking longer after this change. I don't think there should be a big impact, but maybe you can check locally how a sample case performs before and after this change (e.g. `%timeit df.update(other_df)`). Also, you are very welcome to add a benchmark (if you do it, maybe you can open another PR, and we can merge it first, so we can see if there is a regression here).

"datapythonista","MEMBER","I think those are good candidates to reuse a docstring, together with `right`. You can see how we do it in many places with the `@doc` decorator.

Some general comments:

- For `See Also` we want for `left` to surely have `right`. I think we actually want to refer the rest of the 4 methods to each other.
- In `Return` besides the type, in the next line we want to have a description of what's being returned.
- For the `Examples` we want to assign the interval index to a variable, and then show the method, not to create one instance, and then create it again with the method or property being called.","2024-03-05T19:14:39Z",false,"COMMENTED"

I personally thing we should remove the IMPORTANT part and just add a quick note to mention that formatters are not applied to missing values and `na_rep` should be used instead. I understand you are trying to save others from the time you probably wasted because of this problem,  but not sure if it's worth having so much of the docstring for this particular problem, we also want to be concise.

"Dr-Irv","CONTRIBUTOR","I'm not sure that a PDEP is needed here.  Having said that, I think it is important to specifically say what work is required of the pandas core team to support this PDEP. There are a few things to consider:

1. What work by the pandas team is required up front (i.e., just one time) to support these translations?  For example, changes to how the web site is built, or an additional button/menu, etc.
2. What ongoing support, if any,  is required by the pandas team to support these translations?
3. If someone updates the English version of a page on the pandas web site, how would the translations get updated?
4. Will the translations clearly indicate that issues with the translations should be reported elsewhere?
5. Suppose at some point the pandas team decides to reorganize the pandas documentation?  Does this need to be coordinated with the translations project?

For me, if the ""cost"" of doing this is just the ""up front"" cost of setting things up, I don't think a PDEP is needed.  But if doing this will create an ongoing burden of support from the pandas team, then a PDEP is most likely warranted.

a lot of these validation paths go through `to_offset` - could we just check that if you run `to_offset(..., is_period=True)` then it raises an informative error message if the return value doesn't have a `_period_dtype_code` attribute?

So here

https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/02011f2b81743f4e9d100aea6c791fa5e8de9933/pandas/_libs/tslibs/offsets.pyx#L4840-L4849

instead of returning, assign the return value to a variable (say, `delta`, as that's what's used below)

then, just after

could you add a whatsnew note for 3.0 please?

could you also update the `date_range` docs please? they currently don't account for negative frequencies, they just say

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","As mentioned in the issue, the use case for subclassing pandas objects where a given attribute may be doing computation when accessed makes sense to avoid. I also like less try-excepts here. That said - this also appears to me it might make the code more fragile. An update to `__getattribute__` not mirrored here could break things.

If I run
```python
df = pd.Series([], name=""a"", dtype=""large_string[pyarrow]"").to_frame()
dfi = df.__dataframe__()
result = pd.api.interchange.from_dataframe(dfi)
print(dfi.__dataframe__().get_column_by_name('a').get_buffers()['data'])

then I get
```
(PandasBuffer({'bufsize': 0, 'ptr': 94739763740952, 'device': 'CPU'}), (<DtypeKind.STRING: 21>, 8, 'u', '='))

"twoertwein","MEMBER","I like how ruff seems to handle the typing ignore codes slightly differently than black:

- seems like they are ignored from the line length limit (no more running mypy again after formatting moves the ignore code around); and
- ruff seems to also prefer to split arguments across lines when multiple were previously covered by a single ignore comments (this makes it easier to know which argument is causing ""troubles"")","2024-01-03T16:09:27Z",false,"APPROVED"

Grepping the codebase for `'//\$'` gives 

> ./pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py
> ./pandas/core/arrays/string_arrow.py

Testing further - it looks like the first affects `dtype=pd.ArrowDtype(pa.string())` while the second one affects `dtype=""string[pyarrow]""`. The fix should be applied to both of the above files.

Also while the test method states `test_str_fullmatch` it seems to be testing `ser.str.match` instead. The fullmatch tests are present in `./pandas/tests/strings/test_find_replace.py`","2023-12-31T16:37:47Z",false,"COMMENTED"

The single-index part looks good

The multi-index part kind of scares me, I'm pretty sure it's going to break

But my question is - do we really need it? It doesn't look to me like it does the right thing in the first place anyway

For example:
```python
In [10]: df = pd.DataFrame({'price': [float('nan'), 2., 3., float('nan'), 4., 5.], 'group': [1,1,1,2,2,2]}, index=pd.date_range('2018-01-07', periods=6))

In [11]: df
Out[11]: 
            price  group
2018-01-07    NaN      1
2018-01-08    2.0      1
2018-01-09    3.0      1
2018-01-10    NaN      2
2018-01-11    4.0      2
2018-01-12    5.0      2
```

If I did `df.groupby('group').resample('1d').interpolate()` I'd expect it to resample to daily and interpolate only within each group. But instead, it ignores the group boundaries?

```
                  price  group
group                         
1     2018-01-07    NaN      1
      2018-01-08    2.0      1
      2018-01-09    3.0      1
2     2018-01-10    3.5      2
      2018-01-11    4.0      2
      2018-01-12    5.0      2
```

How about we just raise `NotImplementedError` in the `if isinstance(final_index, MultiIndex):` branch?","2024-03-20T19:45:32Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"attack68","CONTRIBUTOR","You will observe that `values` is `data` converted to numpy array.
Since you have replaced this by `data.min` and `data.max` to solve the problem of `left` and `right` I question whether there is the need to still wrap this within `np.nanmin` and `np.nanmax`. Probably not if the pandas function returns a scalar in all cases.

Then the next question is what are the other uses of `values`. In the code below you will observe the function `np.nanmean(values)`. Does this mean your fix will not work when `align=""mean""`? Or if `align` is callable?

`values` is also used when there is a `cmap`. 

Your solution may well work for this case and I believe is still a good improvement, but I do not believe that it fully solves the underlying issue and errors may still result when different arguments are used on this function.

Do you want to attempt these or just propose this to address just the issue in this particular case?","2023-12-09T09:04:21Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"mroeschke","MEMBER","> Breaking up a parameterized test and duplicating code across multiple files seems pretty bad. While I don't love having test_all_methods (it's sort of a catch-all), at first it seemed to me that it is less bad than breaking up the parameterized tests.

IMO I think in the future this could be rolled into a potential refactor of `test_groupby.py` as a file testing ""groupby scenarios that should work with all methods""","2023-12-05T17:48:24Z",false,"APPROVED"

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Nice work! Sorry this has taken me a while

First, can we move this to the 2.3.0 whatsnew note please?

Second, is it possible to fix the two bugs independently?
As in, I think you can just remove the
```
    elif end and not offset.is_on_offset(end):
        # Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type ""datetime"",
        # variable has type ""Optional[Timestamp]"")
        end = offset.rollback(end)  # type: ignore[assignment]
```
completely, and all existing tests will pass, as well the snippet from `56134`?

If so, I'd suggest splitting this - first, remove the unnecessary `elif end` block, and then we fix the `if start and not ...` one separately","2024-01-10T15:56:22Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"jorisvandenbossche","MEMBER","Looks good to me.

I might want to say something like: ""in the future this will no longer copy by default, so you don't need to specify this keyword"", but the problem is in being both succinct and accurate, because of course that isn't fully true, we will copy later on. Which is what your ""lazy copy"" covers, but then I don't know how many people will fully understand that. 

Do we want to also make use of this note to mention ""you can already get that future behaviour by enabling CoW, see ...` ?","2023-11-20T14:17:48Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"datapythonista","MEMBER","Thanks @shiersansi.

I think you misunderstood the list on the description. You shouldn't ignore the existing items in the list, and add one of what you did. You need to do what the existing items say, and check them to show that you did the relevant points. If you see the CI, you'll see there are error, that you could have detected earlier with the tasks in that list. No big deal having run those things locally, but they'll be helpful to prevent the CI being red, which prevents us from merging this. ","2023-10-07T20:21:24Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"datapythonista","MEMBER","Thanks for the contribution @shiersansi. I think you misunderstood a bit the point we're trying to make here. I would say that the main point is that `df.index.levels` contains the original levels of the multiindex, even if `df.index` contains less levels.

I think the issue mentioned that we should add this to the `MultiIndex.level` docstring, not to the user guide, where it's already here: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/advanced.html#defined-levels

Can you please revert the changes here, and add a docstring for `MultiIndex.levels` instead with this comment? I'll open a new issue to be clearer on what needs to be done.

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","Thanks for taking this up! I think it's looking good. The main issue I see is combining different indices - methods like Series.mask use alignment, and I think we should do so here. My guess is that we could use the logic of `pd.concat(..., axis=1)` to determine the resulting index. We may also want to allow both inner or outer joins when doing this.","2023-10-08T23:43:21Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"datapythonista","MEMBER","Thanks for the contribution @PiotrekB416, and sorry it too so long to review, seems like this PR was forgotten in the long list of PRs we have.

It's a bit difficult to understand all possible cases reading the diff, and I'm worried that by fixing the bug we may be introducing new ones.

What I'd like to see in general is that you keep existing tests as they are (in general we shouldn't have wrong cases as tests), and that you add one new test that it reproduces the fixed issue.

In this case the test seems a bit cumbersome, was it asserting cases with the behavior we consider a bug in this PR?

@MarcoGorelli do you have an opinion here?","2023-11-17T14:25:40Z",false,"COMMENTED"

Well, find the source that contains the broken link, and replace it with a working one.

> The linkcheck is showing proper output , then why the ci is showing it as failure ?

The whole point of the linkcheck CI is to fail in case there are broken links. Meaning, this PR cannot be merged until the links are fixed.

Alternatively, `sphinx-build linkcheck` has [options to ignore certain failures](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#options-for-the-linkcheck-builder). You could also add ignores for all broken links for now and chip away at the ignore list later on. The options need to go into [`conf.py`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/doc/source/conf.py).

If I were you, I would probably write a small script to parse the output of the CI run, which you can download [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commit/8484c630aa685b7d03094dca0834a1785a910e11/checks/17143503456/logs), to automatically create the ignore list.","2023-09-27T17:52:42Z",false,"COMMENTED"

There is no point on starting with this until this PR is merged.

> And what about this https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/55246#discussion_r1339864162 ? The anchor issues ?

All errors that are surfaced by the new CI check need to be either fixed or ignored before this PR can be merged. As suggested previously, I would ignore everything for now and open an issue to get some help in fixing the links. The ignore list can likely be build programmatically from the output of the CI job.","2023-09-28T11:30:17Z",false,"COMMENTED"

No. The script is a one-time usage. When the ignore list is generated, we no longer need it. You can post it in this thread if its not too long or other throw it into a Github Gist for future reference.

> where shoould I put that into the conf.py file ?

What is ""that"" here? The ignore list? I would just put it at the end of `conf.py`. If someone complains later, we can always move it.","2023-10-05T08:30:58Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"datapythonista","MEMBER","Thanks @logankilpatrick for the contribution.

Do you mind limiting the line length to something like 80 or 100 please? We don't have a strong limiting, but very long lines are more difficult to deal with, for example in git diff, so we try to keep our docs this way.

For the list, can you remove the blank lines between list items? I think Sphinx won't render the list correctly otherwise.

Thank you!","2023-10-07T11:17:32Z",false,"COMMENTED"

- in the `guess_Datetime_format` docstring, where it says

could you write that as a sphinx directive? so `.. warning::`. check the `to_datetime` docs, there's something similar there

- could we add an example to the docstring please? just a simple one-liner of it guessing a datetime format, and another one-liner of it not being able to guess another one, will do","2023-09-13T19:26:10Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

@phofl you OK with merging this as-is, with the understanding that formal deprecation cycle will be done later before the argument is actually removed?

Regarding the date mentioned - to be honest I'm OK with it, it just says it'll happen at some point after that date, not that it'll happen on that date","2023-09-06T17:11:42Z",false,"APPROVED"

"Dr-Irv","CONTRIBUTOR","I think the main issue here is that the current behavior of `Series.apply()` is dependent on whether the passed function is an aggregation-like function (e.g., `sum`, `abs`, `min`, etc.) or a true ufunc that operates on a scalar (e.g., `abs`, `np.sqrt`, `len`, `np.sin`, etc.)

Your write-up is mixing up these use cases, and I think that is the main source of confusion for users.

It seems to me that we should have people no longer use `Series.apply` at all, and have them use `Series.agg()` if the function is aggregation-like, and use `Series.map()` or `Series.transform()` if the function is a true ufunc.

- Maybe use `TypeError` instead of `ValueError`
- use `...` in overloads (I did not comment on all of them)
- Emit a deprecation warning when the old argument is non-`None`
- Could be in a separate PR: it would be nice to update the function body to use the new positional-only argument, i.e., `path = filepath_or_buffer` instead of `filepath_or_buffer = path` (if that is the case, we could also declare the soon-to be-deprecated argument as `filepath_or_buffer: None = None`, then mypy/pyright will also warn)
- Consistently quote the argument name in the error messages.","2023-09-05T00:26:27Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","This is overwriting a property on a class, replacing it with (presumably) a Python dictionary. More generally, it is relying on modifying global state but not by any standard approach (e.g. options). I _think_ it is also requiring users to access a class that was previously internal, further confusing the public/private nature of `pandas.io` that I think we should be trying to clear up.

For these reasons, I'm -1 on this approach in its current state. Is using an option for this appropriate?","2023-07-09T21:53:35Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

sorry, I didn't explain the issue very clearly

the original issue was about `Series.corr`, so let's add an example there instead

How about an example in which we show:
```python
>>> s1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=[0, 1, 2])
>>> s2 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=[2, 1, 0])

Does this always work? For example, if we have
```python

In [39]: df = pd.DataFrame({'ts': [datetime(1999, 12, 31, 20)], 'values': [10.]})

In [40]: df
Out[40]:
                   ts  values
0 1999-12-31 20:00:00    10.0
```

and do
```python
df.resample('3YS', on='ts', closed='left', label='left', origin=datetime(1995, 1, 1))['values'].sum()
```
then I'd expect the windows to be:
- [1995-01-01, 1998-01-01)
- [1998-01-01, 2001-01-01)

But instead, I see:
```python
In [42]: df.resample('3YS', on='ts', closed='left', label='left', origin=datetime(1995, 1, 1))['values'].sum()
Out[42]:
ts
1999-01-01    10.0

I've just moved this to the 2.0.3 milestone, as technically it's a regression introduced by version 2.0.0 (before, `.dt.weekday` was always correct, as timestamps were only supported between about 1700 and 2300)

could you explain what the various letters you've introduced (e.g. `e`) refer to please?

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","wonderful, nice work!

@mroeschke wondering if this should be backported to 2.0.2 actually, as pdep-4 was new in 2.0

EDIT: yeah let's backport, `guess_datetime_format` only started being used by default in 2.0 so I'd consider this a regression. Will merge later today if there's no other comments

> decide whether dtype should be required. 

The reason to _not_ do this would be that when starting with an int64[pyarrow], you could end up with float64[pyarrow]? 
However, given that this is essentially a full type system (all possible types are available in ArrowDtype), that would essentially make this non-strict for those?

(so I would maybe start with requiring a `dtype`)

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","> The alternative was to load them at `import pandas` which doesn't make it possible to disable it via options, which would be executed when connectors are already loaded. I think making this opt-in initially is a good idea, and if in a future version we want to make plugins load by default...

I'm fine with the current implementation, but I do feel strongly against making this the default with the current behavior of raising when there is a conflict. To me, that is an entire new level of dependency hell where say pip installs just fine but I can't use package X because I have package Y and Z installed.

More generally, I think requiring users to modify their environment to use this feature should be avoided at all costs. Would it be possible to have an option specifying which ones to skip?","2023-05-22T19:59:41Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"rhshadrach","MEMBER","This does not look correct to me; in particular, `np.inf + np.nan` should be `np.nan` and if I'm understanding this code it would come out to `np.inf`. In addition, this doesn't look like it handles `-np.inf`.

Instead, I would guess that when `val` is +/- np.inf, then `compensation` should be set to 0.

This additional check would make the current implementation more complex in the inner for loop, and I'm wondering if the additional numerical accuracy is worth the perf hit. But maybe branch prediction means the perf hit would be minimal in what I would expect to be the typical case (no inf).","2023-04-28T01:46:57Z",false,"COMMENTED"

"datapythonista","MEMBER","The ecosystem page is duplicated, we have a copy in the website and this one in the docs. Not sure which one is more updated, or if additions arbitrarily go to any of them.

Personally I think we should only keep the website one. The reason we've got independent website and docs is that we want to have the release specific documentation versioned, while having the website being updated immediately once there is a change. I think the ecosystem is an obvious case where we want have a single updated ecosystem page, and not one per pandas release.

just for my understanding, why `arr[0, ...]` instead of `arr[0]`? the former returns a scalar containing the value, the latter the actual value - does it make any difference?

There are a bunch of things we might want to type check for (objects are only one part, but there are also arrow specific dtype checks).

"datapythonista","MEMBER","This seems reasonable.

Not sure the context when the job was created, but testing that pandas can be imported when installed with an sdist with an old numpy installed seems redundant and somehow cumbersome, given that we run all the test suite with the old numpy and we test the sdist.

Somehow unrelated. Would it make sense to run the tests on the same jobs we build the wheels? From the release point of view, feels like it'd make sense to test on the CI what's really being released.

Also, how do you feel about copying the recipe from feedstock to this repo, and having a CI job to build the conda package? That would be nice to avoid having to update the recipe during the release process.","2023-04-27T22:54:34Z",false,"APPROVED"

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Thanks for amending!

I think there's agreement that defaulting `pd.Series(['foo'])` to `pyarrow[string]` would be a better user experience. So how to we get there?

a) raise if `pyarrow` isn't installed (likewise IO functions), and users who can't install pyarrow have to specify `dtype=object` everywhere they want strings
b) make `pyarrow` a required dependency

IIUC, the first option would be a bad user experience and introduce lots of complexity (which there's already too much of). @bashtage commented above that it would effectively make `pyarrow` required.

Introducing a `FutureWarning` in 2.1 and then defaulting `pd.Series(['foo'])` to `pyarrow[string]` in `3.0` sounds like a good plan to me. This should give people time to switch to a different Docker base image in the unlikely event that their current one doesn't allow ""pip install pandas"".

So, in favour, +1","2023-05-09T08:14:08Z",false,"APPROVED"

With the change to requiring it in 3.0, and an appropriate deprecation message (preferably when someone imports pandas without pyarrow being installed), I'm supportive of the proposal.","2023-05-09T13:45:14Z",false,"DISMISSED"

I'll leave open a bit in case others (@jbrockmendel ? @phofl ?) have comments, else can merge

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Wait sorry, I gave a bad review here - this introduces an inconsistency between `first('M')` and `first(MonthEnd())` (which should mean the same thing - reminder that 'M' means 'month end'):
```python
In [1]: ser = pd.Series([1,2,3], index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2020-01-31', '2020-02-01', '2020-03-01']))

In [2]: ser.first(MonthEnd())
Out[2]: 
2020-01-31    1
2020-02-01    2
dtype: int64

In [3]: ser.first('M')
Out[3]: 
2020-01-31    1
dtype: int64
```

@jbrockmendel is there a way to tell if an offset is `DateOffset` but not `MonthEnd`? I was a bit surprised to see
```python
In [11]: isinstance(MonthEnd(), DateOffset)
Out[11]: True
```
. `type(offset) is DateOffset` would technically work, but I don't see it being done anywhere else

(as an aside, the fact that the tests still pass indicates the relatively poor test coverage that this function had to begin with)","2023-04-21T14:07:16Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"jorisvandenbossche","MEMBER","My reading of the issue https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/51772 is not that there is any kind of agreement that we actually want to do this. 
I actually asked clarification of the motivation and provided arguments why I think this is not such a useful change (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/51772#issuecomment-1483785007), and since then got not even a reply to that.","2023-04-07T12:49:02Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Thanks @ngoldbaum for your PR!

Agree that this is much easier to read, good one

Could you please explain why now we need to pass
```
dtype=self.dtype_mapping[dtype]
```
? Looks like the default is `object`, so here this only makes a difference for `str` dtype - why is it better to pass `dtype=str` for that one?","2023-04-04T16:22:01Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"

"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Hi @GrammatikakisDimitris 

Apologies, I think this is actually working as-expected, see this comment: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/52405#issuecomment-1497463366

I think we can close then, sorry for having lead you down the wrong path","2023-04-05T13:13:49Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"
"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Thanks @liang3zy22 for your PR! this is off to a good start

I just have some comments:
1. can we not use random numbers in the test please? let's use explicit input and output
2. the test location might not be appropriate - `test_array` is about the pandas array. How about pandas/tests/frame/test_npfuncs.py?
3. not too keen on single-letter variable names, we can use `arr` please to construct a numpy array?","2023-04-04T16:03:51Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"
"MarcoGorelli","MEMBER","Nice, thanks for updating!

The example if quite long now - can we trim it down so the matrix is just 2 rows by 3 columns?

Then we can get this in","2023-04-05T13:28:01Z",false,"CHANGES_REQUESTED"
